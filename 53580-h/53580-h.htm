<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p><i>Gregory Petrovitch Danilevski was born at
Danilovki, an estate in the government of Kharkov,
on April 14th, 1829. He died last winter at St.
Petersburg, on December 6th. His childhood over&mdash;it
was spent partly on the estate of his grandfather,
near Dontsov, partly on the estate of Petrovski&mdash;he
became a student first of the Muscovite Institute
for the nobility, afterwards of the University
of St. Petersburg, leaving the latter, in 1850, as
graduate in jurisprudence. In 1848, during his
studentship, he was presented with a silver medal
at the meeting of the Philological Institute for his
composition on Poushkin and Kriloff.</i></p>

<p><i>From 1850 to 1857 he served in the ministry of
public instruction, at first under Noroff, afterwards
under Prince Viazimski. During this period he
visited Finland and the Crimea, and worked, by
commission from the Archæological Society, on the
archives of the monasteries of the governments of
Kharkov, Koursk, and Poltava, and, at the suggestion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
of the historian Oustrialoff, wrote a description
of the famous battlefield of the last-named place.
In 1856, at the instance of the Imperial admiral,
Constantine Nicolaievitch, he was sent to the south
of Russia to write a description of the Sea of Azov,
the Dnieper, and the Don. In the following year
he resigned his official appointment. Thereafter,
for twelve years, he lived at Petrovski, his own
favourite estate in Kharkov, from time to time,
however, paying visits to Poland, White Russia,
Volhynie, and Podolia, and sailing down the
Volga, Don, and Dnieper. Made in 1859 deputy
of the committee of Kharkov for improving the
condition of the peasantry, he was instructed four
years later, by Golovinin, the minister of public
instruction, to inspect and to report on the condition
of 200 national schools in the government
of Kharkov. During the first three years of the
establishment of the rural police courts he served
by election. Despatched to St. Petersburg in 1868
as a deputy by the government of Kharkov, he had
the honour of being presented to the emperor.
From 1867 to 1870 he held the post of honorary
justice of the peace. Finally, in 1869, on the
institution of the official organ, “The Government
Herald,” he was appointed senior assistant to the
chief editor. This post he occupied eleven years.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span></p>

<p><i>His historical novels have created quite a sensation
in Russia by reason of their originality, their
fascination, and their truthfulness to history and to
nature. Among the more celebrated of his numerous
works, besides the novel of which a translation is here
presented, are “Merovitch” and “Freedom.” As
Danilevski has, hitherto, been unknown in England,
some remarks on his writings will be of interest.</i></p>

<p><i>With regard to the sad history contained in this
book, it is evident that the author had exceptional
information on the subject of his narrative, for
he is not over-careful to conceal his opinion of
the strong probability of the Princess Tarakanova’s
claims being legitimate as well as <span class="antiqua" lang="fr">bonâ-fide</span>, and
of Orloff’s real character being greatly different
from the popular estimate of it as expressed in
the lines under the count’s portrait. It is not
known how the remarkable diary which constitutes
Part I. of this work came into Danilevski’s hands;
but there is ground for the conjecture that it came
to him, with other papers, from his grandmother.
A curious fact, too, is the circumstance that
Danilevski’s governess was a lady of the name of
Pchelkina. However this may be, my husband,
Colonel de Génie de Mouchanoff, was informed by
Danilevski himself that the diary as published is
almost word for word as written by Konsov, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
that the details concerning the subsequent history
of the captive were obtained by him from authentic
official documents.</i></p>

<p><i>Nevertheless, Danilevski’s view is not the popular
one. Schébalski and Solovieff in dealing with this
subject write as follows:&mdash;</i></p>

<p><i>“When Russia was involved in the war with
Turkey some evil-minded persons availed themselves
of the opportunity to bring forward pretenders to
the throne. They set rumours afloat to the effect
that Elizabeth, after her secret marriage with Count
Razoumovski, had a daughter, and that this child
was she who was known by the name of Princess
Tarakanova.</i></p>

<p><i>“The adventures of this Pretender form a very
interesting page in Russian history, and have given
rise to many novels and tales. They have now,
however, lost much of their mysterious interest,
thanks to the extracts printed from the procés of
Princess Tarakanova, not long since published in
one of our historical reviews. Still, it is an ascertained
fact that the Princess spent several of the
years of her youth abroad, and that she led a
luxurious though retired life. Very likely the tie
between this person and the Russian Empress may
have been known to political intriguers, and have
suggested to them the idea of using this Pretender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
as an instrument for raising a revolution in Russia.
There is every reason to believe that Prince Radzivill,
the leader of the confederation of Radomski,
educated a young girl with this object in view; but
whether this girl became the future Tarakanova, or
some other person, is to this day, and most probably
will remain eternally, unknown.</i></p>

<p><i>“What is really ascertained is that a young girl
of very humble origin, a native of Prague or Nuremburg,
endowed with the most marvellous beauty,
clever and enterprising, but of extremely equivocal
conduct, shone from the end of the year 1760
till the beginning of 1770 at Berlin, London, and
Paris, lavishly spending on her dress and pleasures
the money which she had levied on her admirers.
With every new residence she changed her name.
In Paris she was the “Princess Wladimirskaya,”
a native of Russia, but brought up, it was said,
in Persia, as mischief was feared at the hands of
her enemies in Russia, where, so she alleged, she
had great possessions. We are bound, indeed, to
believe that her charms were extraordinary; for
notwithstanding her conduct, several highly placed
personages, in both France and Germany, sought
her hand. One of these was actually a reigning
Prince of the German Empire. In 1773, the
mysterious adventuress was on the point of accepting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
the hand of this prince, but postponed the
matter under pretence of starting for Russia to
arrange her affairs, and then suddenly disappeared.
In the spring of 1774 she turned up at the other
side of Europe&mdash;at Venice.</i></p>

<p><i>“It was then that her political <span class="antiqua" lang="fr">rôle</span> really began.
As early as 1773 she had had relations with
several Poles, who had left their native land shortly
after the conspiracy of Baski, and it is not unlikely
that it was at this time that the programme of
her future actions was arranged. The Princess
Wladimirskaya was to take the name of the “Princess
Tarakanova,” set sail for Constantinople on
a ship which Radzivill had offered to equip, and
there explain to the Sultan her pretensions to the
Russian throne. It was evidently the opinion of
her advisers that her appearance on the Danube at
the very moment when Pougachoff was raising a
rebellion on the Volga would increase the difficulties
of Ekaterina’s position, and would be taken advantage
of by Turkish politicians. As a matter
of fact, in the summer of 1774, the Princess Tarakanova
and Prince Radzivill, accompanied by a
numerous suite, did set sail for Constantinople.
But they stopped at Ragusa, wishing to ascertain
beforehand what kind of reception they were likely
to meet with at the hands of the Sultan. Unfortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
for them, great changes had taken place.
The overtures of the Princess were not only declined:
she was even invited to give up all thought
of her visit.</i></p>

<p><i>“Separated from Radzivill, but not from her
political <span class="antiqua" lang="fr">rôle</span>, the Princess went first to Naples and
then to Rome. At the latter city she tried to bring
to her side all the most influential cardinals, and
even the Pope himself, promising that in the event
of her accession to the throne she would do all in
her power to establish the Catholic faith in Russia.</i></p>

<p>“<i>During all these <span class="antiqua" lang="fr">péripéties</span> Count Orloff Chesmenski
was, as we all know, in Italy. Of course
he lost no time in writing full particulars concerning
the false Tarakanova to Ekaterina, from whom
he received orders to steal the Pretender, and so
cut off the intrigue at the very outset. Orloff surrounded
the Princess with spies, and, through his
emissaries, tried to inspire her with confidence in
himself. The words of the emissaries seemed very
credible to the Princess. Gregory Orloff was then
in disgrace, and it would be no very unlikely circumstance
if his brother turned into a secret enemy
of the empress, and joined in the intrigue. Orloff
placed boundless credit at her disposition; and by
giving himself out as a man deeply outraged by the
government, persuaded the “Countess Selinski,” as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
the Princess then called herself, to come to a <span class="antiqua" lang="fr">rendezvous</span>
with him at Pisa. Here he surrounded
her with all possible homage. Balls and <span class="antiqua" lang="fr">fêtes</span>
succeeded each other in swift succession. He made
believe to fall in with her plans, and eventually
offered her his hand. Nevertheless, he was only
awaiting an opportunity to arrest her, without
causing any scandal. He had not long to wait.
One day the Countess Selinski expressed a wish to
visit the Russian squadron, then stationed at
Livorno. Orloff gave orders for preparations to be
made for a magnificent reception of the countess,
and arranged splendid naval manœuvres. He
himself, with her suite, accompanied her on board
the man-o’-war. The manœuvres began; the cannon
fired; sails were unfurled; the ships sailed
out into the open sea; and the unfortunate Pretender,
at the end of a journey, found herself shut
up in the fortress of Petersburg. Here, it is said,
she languished till 1776, when she was drowned by
the rushing of the waters into her prison. But
this is not true. Historical documents prove that
she died of the same illness from which she was
suffering when she came to Russia, and which, of
course, made rapid strides during her confinement
in the damp dungeon.</i>”</p>

<p><i>Remarkable as is “The Princess Tarakanova,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
it is not regarded in Russia as so fine a work as
“Merovitch.” This work has attracted universal
attention, for it describes one of the most interesting
epochs of Russian history. The mysterious
and melancholy account of the unfortunate prince-martyr,
the victim of troublous times, is all the
more interesting as it is founded on historical
documents. Written with great <span class="antiqua" lang="fr">entrain</span> and truthfulness,
the novel on its publication created quite a
sensation. It originally appeared in 1875, under
the title, “The Imperial Prisoner” but its sale was
prohibited. In 1879 it was again printed, by order
of the emperor.</i></p>

<p><i>“The whole canvas of the novel,” says Danilevski,
“such as the life and infatuation of Merovitch, the
customs and manners of the period, many details of
the reign of Ekaterina and the attempt of Merovitch,
are taken from the diary and reminiscences of
my great-grandmother, and of my grandmother, who
was <span class="antiqua" lang="de">Fräulein</span> at the court of Peter III. Many
things I took down from the lips of my uncle, the
eldest son of my father’s mother,&mdash;a born Rosslavleff,
who, together with Orloff, as every one knows,
played so conspicuous a part in the <span class="antiqua" lang="fr">Coup-d’État</span>
which placed Ekaterina on the throne. But in all
that belongs to history, I have, of course, strictly
adhered to authentic documents from the Imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
archives. I have also had access to the archives of
the citadel of Schlusselburg, to the official documents
of the council of Archangel, and I have visited
the celebrated dungeon of the unfortunate Prince
Johann Antonovitch, and the birthplace of
‘Merovitch.’”</i></p>

<p><i>“Merovitch” is thus a detailed account of the
<span class="antiqua" lang="fr">Coup-d’État</span> which placed Ekaterina on the
throne of Russia, and of the conspiracy and attempt
to put Johann Antonovitch on the throne, which was
his by right.</i></p>

<p><i>An officer named Merovitch penetrated into the
citadel above referred to, and hoping to surprise the
sentinels and throw them off their guard, read a
proclamation, trusting to be able in the confusion to
facilitate the escape of the unfortunate prince. But
long before strict orders had been given (it is supposed
by Ekaterina) that at the first attempt at escape
on the part of the prince he was to be killed on
the spot. This command was strictly carried out.
When Merovitch entered the prince’s cell, he found
only the dead body of the unfortunate martyr.</i></p>

<p><i>Ekaterina II. plays so important a part in the
events described in these novels that some particulars
of her life and character may not be out of place.</i></p>

<p><i>She was born in the year 1729, at Stettin.
Her father, a general in the Prussian service, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
the governor of this town, inherited by the death
of his cousin, the Prince of Zerbst, a small principality,
situated on the borders of the Elbe,
between Prussia and Saxony.</i></p>

<p><i>Her mother came of the house of Holstein.
Princess Sophie Augusta of Anhalt-Zerbst was
therefore distantly related to her future husband.
She came over to Russia in her fourteenth year
with her mother, and was at once instructed in the
Russian faith and tongue. The following year,
1745, having been baptized into the Greek faith
under the name of Ekaterina Alexéevna, she was
united to the heir of the Russian empire.</i></p>

<p><i>Her husband on his accession to the throne
excited the discontent of the nation by publishing a
great number of ukases, which, although in themselves
most humane and wise, yet, owing to the
uncivilized state of Russia, were in their nature far
too premature. Above all, he outraged the national
feeling by the treaty which he concluded with
Prussia on April 24th, 1762, by which Russia returned
to Prussia all forts, citadels, and towns taken
in the last war. His Imperial Highness wished,
it was said, to give to the world an example of
abnegation and generosity. It was a marvellous
event; but although nations like to see in their
sovereigns high moral qualities, they also desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
that advantages for which they have worked hard
and shed their blood should not be wholly thrown
away. By this one act Peter III. raised the whole
nation against him.</i></p>

<p><i>Ekaterina, his consort, had won a great many
adherents by her beauty, grace, and accomplishments,
and many true friends among the nobility.
Exceedingly ambitious, she had&mdash;with the view, as
we may suppose, of one day ascending the throne&mdash;made
herself thoroughly well acquainted with
Russian legislation and European politics; and
being as deeply devoted as her husband was profoundly
indifferent to the Greek Church and its
ceremonies and symbols, and having in this way
established herself in the affections of the Russian
peasantry&mdash;so superstitiously reverential to their
Church,&mdash;she found it no difficult matter to supplant
her less capable and unpopular partner. He, as is
well known, not only ill-used her, but was unfaithful
to her. Indeed, it was rumoured that the fate of
the unfortunate Princess Eudoxie (who had been
forced to take the veil) was awaiting her. Her
successor was even named&mdash;viz., the niece of the
chancellor Vorontzoff, a woman who, as all contemporary
writers say, was not only ugly and deformed,
but also most insignificant and illiterate. Meanwhile,
Ekaterina’s conduct had been wholly irreproachable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
She was then at Peterhoff, leading a
most retired life, but sometimes meeting her adherents,
especially the two Orloffs, and the Princess Dashkoff.</i></p>

<p><i>The <span class="antiqua" lang="fr">Coup-d’État</span> was to have taken place on
June 29th, at the patronal <span class="antiqua" lang="fr">fête</span> of the emperor;
but the arrest of Passek, captain of the regiment of
Préobrajenski, together with the order given to the
army to march against Denmark, brought about the
crisis. Rumours had been set afloat that the empress
was in danger. The guards, who were all
devoted to the empress&mdash;40 officers and about 10,000
privates&mdash;noisily demanded to be sent to Oranienbaum,
to the defence of their beloved empress.
One of the privates rushed to Captain Passek,
exclaiming that the empress was in danger, that
an ukase ordering her arrest had been issued.
Passek answered that it was all nonsense. The
private, horrified, rushed to another officer, who on
hearing the news, and learning that he had been to
Passek, then on duty, arrested him and led him to
Voyeïkoff. And the latter, in his turn, arrested
Passek, and sent a report to Oranienbaum. Of
course the arrest of Passek threw the whole regiment,
as well as the conspirators in other regiments,
into a panic. It was decided to send Orloff to
Peterhoff to escort the empress to Petersburg.</i></p>

<p><i>It was six o’clock in the morning when Orloff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
reached Peterhoff. He knocked at the empress’s
door, walked in, and very coolly said, “It is time
to get up; all is ready!” “What! how?” exclaimed
Ekaterina. “Passek is arrested” answered
Orloff. Ekaterina asked no more questions,
but, hastily dressing, took her seat inside the carriage.
Orloff sat by the coachman; another officer,
Bibikoff, rode at the door. They made straight for
the barracks of Ismaïloff. The alarm was given.
Soldiers ran out, surrounded the empress, kissing
her hands, her garments, calling her their
“saviour.” Two soldiers led a priest up, and all
crowded to her to take the oath of allegiance. The
empress was invited to take her place in the carriage
again. The priest, with the cross, went on
ahead. Soon they all arrived at the barracks of
Simeon, followed by the two regiments. These
accompanied her to the cathedral of Kazan, where
the Archbishop Dimitri met her. The <span class="antiqua" lang="la">Te Deum</span>
was sung, and Ekaterina Alexéevna was proclaimed
Empress of Russia, and Pavel Petrovitch, her son,
heir to the throne, 28th June, 1762.</i></p>

<p><i>On leaving the cathedral the empress was driven
to the Winter Palace, where she took up her
residence.</i></p>

<p><i>Meanwhile, Peter III. was quite ignorant of
these events. At the very time when Ekaterina was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
being proclaimed empress, he was preparing to
start with a large and brilliant suite for Peterhoff,
where, as had been before decided, his fête was to
be celebrated. An officer, Goodovitch, who had gone
on before, suddenly returned with all haste and
whispered softly to Peter that the empress had left
the palace long ago, and was now nowhere to be
found. The emperor, in a passion, jumped out of
his carriage and walked rapidly to the pavilion
“Mon-Plaisir,” but found nothing save his consort’s
ball-dress, ready for the <span class="antiqua" lang="fr">fête</span>. “Did I not tell you
she was bold enough for anything?” was Peter’s
first exclamation. Originally, it was the intention
of Peter to assert his rights; but the representations
of his friends, the small number of his followers,
and the fervour shown to the new empress,
all combined to shake his resolution, and the same
day he signed his abdication.</i></p>

<p><i>Seven days later he died in the palace of
Ropshoe&mdash;poisoned, as it is supposed.</i></p>

<p><i>Ekaterina died on November 6th, 1796, at the
age of 67.</i></p>

<p><i>In estimating the character of this famous woman,
we must not judge her actions as we should those of
a private person. Indeed, in reflecting on the lives
of those who have, it may be said, to answer for
the welfare and prosperity of nations, we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
never forget the fact that these high personages
have often, sometimes against their own feelings,
to sacrifice the life of one for the well-being of
thousands. Nor should we fail to take into account
the character of the times in which Ekaterina
ascended the throne. When her reign is compared
with the reigns of those who preceded her, it appears
in any but an unpleasant light. Indeed, it is
impossible not to admire the empress for the
humanity of her laws, and for the example she set to
all her court in frugality, industry, and simplicity.</i></p>

<p><i>The poet Derjavin wrote an ode in her honour,
in which he contrasted her manner of living with
that of her courtiers. She rose very early, was
always occupied, devoted several hours every day to
new projects, laws, etc., for different institutions,
more often she went on foot than she drove. Her
table was most frugal, although of course she had
every luxury at her command. Cards were all the
rage then, especially the most hazardous game of
“Faro,” which as grand-duchess she had been
made to play at court. But after she ascended the
throne she never played at games of chance again.
She did not care very much for masquerade balls,
only taking part in them on solemn occasions.</i></p>

<p><i>On her accession she found all legislation, all
administration of justice in most frightful chaos, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
reduced everything to order. “Of darkness she made
light.” Justice could no longer be bought or sold.</i></p>

<p><i>She was never proud: to the meanest of her
subjects always easy of access. Nor was she ever
offended at hearing the unvarnished truth&mdash;witness
her polemic with Von Viesing. She did not resent
the most bitter criticism.</i></p>

<p><i>By an ukase she put down a most horrible
institution called Slovo-i-diélo,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which somewhat
resembled the Star Chamber. So strict had the
laws been that people could be brought to the torture
for having whispered at their own tables one to
another; for not having drunk the health of the
reigning Sovereign; for having scratched out the
Imperial name and rewritten it; for having dropped
money on which was stamped the Imperial effigy.
Very differently from one of her predecessors, Anna
Johannovna, she did not exact that her courtiers
should be sitting on baskets in rows along the
rooms through which she had to pass from the
chapel to her own rooms, and cackle like hens.
Nor used she to slap her courtiers’ faces. She
built no ice palace to marry her jester and jestress
in; she allowed none of her favourites to blacken
with soot the faces of the proud old aristocracy, “to
make an empress laugh.” She was the first to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
teach her subjects self-respect. She wrote an excellent
moral tale for her grandson, in which, admonishing
him to shun flatterers, she told him that
to be invulnerable to slander, “Do no ill, and the
bitterest traducer will stand before the world a
convicted liar.” She abolished torture on reading
the interrogation of Volhynski, a Russian boyar,
brought to torture for supposed treason, and in her
testament she willed that her descendants should
read that piece of conviction to stifle in them any
inclination to cruelty.</i></p>

<p><i>She was the first to divide the Russian Empire
into provinces, and to give each province self-government.
She opened the first national schools,
cadet-corps, and two splendid half-school, half-convent-like
institutions for the education of the
daughters of the nobility. She promulgated an
ukase allowing landlords to work the mines of gold
and silver found on their own properties, which
before had been strictly forbidden; and made all
the rivers and seas free of access to every one&mdash;<span class="antiqua">i.e.</span>,
every one might sail on them, use them for mills,
etc. She tried to encourage weaving, spinning and
sewing, science and commerce, and gave permission
to all her subjects to travel&mdash;then an unknown
liberty. It is the boast of Russians that in her
reign no beggars were to be found, owing, no doubt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
to her humane laws regarding the serfs. Every
landlord was compelled to keep on his estate, and
to provide for, every serf, whether the serf were
able to work or not. It would, in fact, take too long
to enumerate all the numerous acts of clemency,
justice, and wisdom of this wise, prudent, and far-seeing
empress. If her frailty as a woman calls
for the world’s censure, no one, on reading her
history, can forbear bringing to her feet the tribute
she so well deserves as an empress.</i></p>

<p><i>In the present translation I have tried to preserve,
as far as possible, the quaintness and
piquancy of the original Russian, but I fear that
in thus endeavouring to produce a faithful copy of
the author’s work I have often sacrificed elegant
and correct English. Only those who know how
terse and vigorous a language the Russian is will
be able to appreciate the translator’s difficulties,
which are greater than those of an author of a new
work, so far as the mere writing of it is concerned.
Whilst it is often impossible to adhere strictly to
the author’s words without producing obscurities,
the use of lengthy phrases and even whole sentences
to express the full sense of the original, means, on
the other hand, the annihilation of the author’s style.
As a rule, translators of Russian works, in their
endeavour to make their renderings readable, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
succeed in producing a tale in common-place
English, with a foreign plot, long drawn out, devoid
of colour, and wearisome to read,&mdash;barely recognisable
sometimes by those who are conversant with
the original.</i></p>

<p><i>To assist those who are not familiar with Russia
and Russian history, I have explained various
references in the text by means of footnotes; and to
excite a more lively interest in the characters, I have
included portraits. The frontispiece is a reproduction
of an engraving taken from a celebrated painting
which embodies the popular legend concerning
the Princess Tarakanova’s last hours.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The portraits
of Orloff and Ekaterina are reproduced from
old and rare engravings. Danilevski’s likeness is
from a photograph taken some years ago.</i></p>

<p><i>In conclusion, conscious of many faults and
oversights in a translation originally not intended
for publication, I have to acknowledge that I am
most indebted to Mr. F. Dillon Woon, of Wallington,
England, for his kind aid and criticism, and
to accord him my best thanks.</i></p>

<p>A storm has been raging for already three days.
We have been so tossed about that it has been
impossible to write. Our frigate, the <i>Northern

powers of memory; enlighten my poor soul, so
torn with doubt!</p>

<p class="tb">I am a sailor, Pavel Konsov, an officer in the
navy of our most gracious Majesty, Empress of
all the Russias, Ekaterina II. Five years ago,
by the mercy of God, I succeeded in distinguishing
myself at the famous battle of Chesma. All
the world knows of our brave companions,
Lieutenant Elien and Lieutenant Klokachov, who,
on the night of the twenty-sixth of June, 1770,
with four fire-ships and a few Grecian boats,
hastily equipped, bravely advanced upon the
Turkish fleet at Chesma, and rendered valuable
assistance in its destruction. I, though so insignificant,
had the good fortune, under cover of the
fire-ships and the dark, to throw with my own
hand, from our ship, <i>January</i>, the first fire-ball
at the enemy. It was this fire-ball which, falling
into and igniting the powder magazine, caused
the explosion near the ship of the Turkish admiral
from which the whole fleet took fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning, of over a hundred formidable
men-of-war, some of sixty and some of ninety
guns, frigates, galliots, and <i lang="fr">galères</i>,&mdash;not one
remained! On the surface of the waters were
visible only wreckage and numbers of dead
bodies.</p>

<p>Our victory was sung in odes by the celebrated
poet Heraskov, and several lines were dedicated
to my humble self, until then unknown to the
world. This poem was in every one’s mouth.
The English in the Russian service&mdash;for instance,
Mackenzie and Dugdale, who served on one of
the fire-ships&mdash;took to themselves the credit for
the greater part of the glory won at the battle
of Chesma. But they did not really much
surpass our own officers and men, who all
distinguished themselves by their courage and
gallantry. After this event I was found worthy
of receiving the rank of lieutenant, and the
Count Alexis Orloff, the hero of Chesma, having
honoured me by his preference, I became his
aide-de-camp. My career was thus, so far, very
fortunate. Life, on the whole, smiled upon me.
But sometimes a fatal destiny pursues man.
Suddenly fortune ceased to favour me, angry
maybe, at my abrupt, albeit forced, departure
from my native land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Resting on our laurels reaped at Chesma, we
led joyous lives. We received flattering invitations
from the French, Spanish, Venetians, and
men of other nations. All at once, upon me,
the alien, there fell a new, unexpected, and very
terrible temptation.</p>

<p>The war continued, but Count Orloff, after
many noisy battles, lived in luxurious ease with
the fleet. He was wont to say, “I am as happy
as Enoch, who was taken up to heaven.” But
these were mere words, for, since he had taken
an active part in placing Ekaterina upon the
throne, wild and bold ideas were ever coursing
through his brain.</p>

<p>Once, when sailing in the Adriatic with the
squadron, he despatched me on a secret mission
to the brave, warlike Montenegros. This was in
the year 1773. The scouts made all arrangements
wisely and adroitly; and at night, taking
with me what I required on shore, I landed
with great caution, and speedily conducted my
business. But on our return voyage we were
sighted and pursued by the Turkish coastguards.
We succeeded in defending ourselves for a considerable
time; but in the end our sailors were
all killed, while I, severely wounded in the
shoulder, lay unconscious at the bottom of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
boat, where I was found, and whence I was removed,
a prisoner, to Stamboul.</p>

<p>I was disguised in a national Albanian costume.
Nevertheless, my captors discovered that I belonged
to the Russian navy, and, at first, thinking
no doubt that they would receive a good
ransom for me, paid me great attention. Ah!
thought I, as soon as they find out that their
prisoner is no other than Lieutenant Konsov,
who threw the first fire-ball which caused the
explosion and destruction of their staffship at
Chesma, what will my lot be then?</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>MY IMPRISONMENT.</i></span></h3>

<p>My imprisonment lasted for about two years,
coming to an end in the year 1775.</p>

<p>At first I was kept shut up in one of the wings
of a seven-towered castle, but afterwards I was
chained and confined in one of the three hundred
mecheti (mosques) of Stamboul. I don’t know
whether at last, by some means, the Turks
learned that one of their prisoners was Konsov,
or whether, having lost all hopes of a ransom,
they resolved to take advantage of my knowledge
and abilities; but this I know, they tried to convert
me to Mohammedanism.</p>

<p>The mosque in which I was imprisoned is
situated on the shores of the Bosphorus, and
through my window-grating I could watch the
blue sea and the vessels sailing to and fro. The
mulla who came to visit me was of Sclavonic
origin; he was a Bulgarian from Gabrova. We
therefore understood one another without much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
difficulty.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> My visitor set to work in a roundabout
way to convert me to the Turkish faith.
He praised the Turkish people, their customs
and morals, and extolled the power and glory
of the Sultan. At first, though very indignant
at all this, I kept silence, but at last I began to
contradict. Thereupon, in order to gain my confidence
in himself and his faith, he obtained as a
first step permission for my removal to a more
comfortable cell, and for my being provided with
better food. Accordingly I was transferred to
the ground floor of the mosque, part of which
the mulla himself inhabited, and was allowed
tobacco and all sorts of sweetmeats and wine.
Still, notwithstanding all this, my chains were
left on me. My teacher (himself a renegade),
according to the law of Mohammed, could not
drink wine, but he enticed and tempted me to.
“Turn Islamist,” he would say, “and then how
happy you will be: your chains will at once fall
off you. And see how many ships there are: you
may enter the Turkish service on one of them,
and in time become one of our captains!”</p>

<p>I lay on my mat without touching any of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
tempting viands, and scarcely hearing a word
that my tempter said, for my mind was filled
with thoughts of my native land. I murmured
the names of my friends and of all dear to me,
and pondered over my lost happiness. My heart
was breaking, my soul was torn with uncertainty
and grief. Ah! how well I remember those sad
hours, filled with such sorrowful musings!</p>

<p>As I now recollect, my thoughts then wandered
to the far-off village, my native Konsovka. I
was an orphan, and already had obtained my
commission. From the training college I had
come straight to the house of my grandmother,
whose name was Agraffena Konsova. Not far
from us, in the town of Baturin, lived Rakitin,
a retired brigadier, a widower, whose estates in
the country adjoined ours. Leff Hieraclieovitch<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
had one daughter, Irena Lvovna. To tell all
briefly, what with going to the church of Rakitin,
visiting Irena at her father’s halls, and our
secret meetings and walks together, we fell in
love with one another. My love for Irena was
passionate and unrestrained. With her dusky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
skin and luxurious black hair, she was charming.
She was my life, my idol, to whom I offered
prayers night and day. We confessed our love,
and day by day became dearer to each other.
Ah! those moments, those meetings, those vows!</p>

<p>We began to send each other love letters, full
of passionate avowals of love. I was always
fond of music, and Irena used to play enchantingly
upon the clavichord, and would sing in a
lovely voice pieces from Glück, Bach, and Handel.
We met often. In this way the summer passed.
Ah! dear and never-to-be-forgotten days!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, one of my letters fell into the
hands of Irena’s father. Was Rakitin too stern
with his daughter, or did he talk her over, and
so persuade her to give me up, to change me for
another?… I know not; it is all too
painful for me even to try to remember.</p>

<p>It was autumn, and, as I well recollect, a
praznik (holiday); we were preparing for church,
when suddenly we heard a carriage drive
into our yard. A footman in splendid livery
came forward, and placed in my grandmother’s
hands a packet which he had brought for her.
My heart throbbed; my presentiments were fulfilled:
Irena’s father had sent a firm and decided
refusal to my suit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Matushka<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Agraffena Vlassovna</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Your Pavel Efstafevitch<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> is worthy in every
way, but he is not a fit husband for my daughter;
and it is useless for him to send love letters to
her. Let him not be offended; we always were
and always shall be friends. My earnest hope
is that your godson and grandchild may find
another bride, a hundred times more suitable
than my daughter.”</p>

</div>

<p>That letter moved me deeply. The light of
heaven seemed extinguished: all that was dearest
to me was lost; all my happiness ruined.</p>

<p>Proud, rich, and related to the Razoumovskis,
Rakitin mercilessly scorned the poor suitor, who
also was of noble blood; yea, of nobler blood
perhaps than Rakitin’s own. His pride in his
distinguished relatives, who had been favourites
of the late empress, had hardened his heart.
Often had I heard Irena addressed by her father
as the future Fräulein (maid of honour).</p>

<p>“God forgive him!” I repeated, like one who
had lost his senses, as I strode up and down the
rooms which once I had loved so much, but which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
now seemed to me so lonely. The day had been
very cloudy, with occasional showers of rain. I
ordered my horse to be saddled, and, in my despair,
rode off to the steppes. I did not draw
rein until I reached the borders of the forest
which surrounded the estate of Rakitin. There
I wandered through the brushwood like a madman.
The wind whistled through the trees and
swept over the bare fields. As night came on, I
fastened my horse to a tree, and, leaving the
forest, made my way through the garden to the
window of Irena’s room. Ah! what I felt at
that moment! I remember, it seemed to me that
I had only to call her, and she would throw herself
into my arms, and we would go together to the
end of the world. Fool that I was! I hoped to
see her, to exchange thoughts with her, to pour
out my heart, so full of bitter pain. “Leave
your father! leave him!” I whispered, gazing in
at her window. “He does not pity you; he does
not love you.” But I pleaded in vain: her window
was dark, and nowhere in all the silent house
could I hear one word or see one sign of life.
On the following night I again went through the
garden, and watched the well-known window,
through which Irena had often given me her
hand or thrown me a letter. Would she not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
look out? would she not give me some message?
One night, after sending her a note, to which I
received no answer, I even determined to kill
myself before her window, and took my pistol in
my hand.</p>

<p>“But no,” I decided. “Why such a sacrifice?
Perhaps Irena has already bartered me for a
richer suitor. Wait a little; I may find out who
the happy rival is.” Afterwards, but too late, I
learned that Rakitin, after writing his refusal of
me, had carried his daughter off to a distant
property owned by one of his relations, somewhere
on the Oka, and was keeping her there in strict
confinement.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>IMPORTANT NEWS.</i></span></h3>

<p>My grandmother was not less struck by this
than I. One day, about a week later, calling me
to her, she said: “You have guessed who your
rival is? One distantly related to the Rakitins;
a prince and Kammerherr (gentleman of the
chamber). I have found out, Pavelinka, that
they sent for him on purpose, and that he was
visiting them all the time you were looking for
her, and that it was he who helped them to carry
her off without leaving any trace. Forget her,
<i lang="fr">mon ange</i>, forget Irena; for no doubt she
resembles her father in his pride. Console yourself.
God will send you a better wife.”</p>

<p>I felt angry and petulant. “My grandmother
is right,” I said; and there and then I determined
to strive to forget everything. If Irena had had
any heart, she would have found some opportunity
of writing me a line and sending it. I remember
especially how one night I found amongst some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
papers a hymn from “Iphigenia,” one of Glück’s
operas not yet produced in Russia, which I had
obtained with great difficulty from an amateur
musician for Irena, but which I had been unable
to give to her. With tears in my eyes I burnt it.
After long days of sorrowful despair, I decided
to leave my birthplace. The parting with my
grandmother was very touching, for we both felt
that we should never meet again.</p>

<p class="tb">Agraffena Vlassovna, during her retreat in a
neighbouring convent, took cold, and after a
short illness, died. I was left alone in the world,
like a forgotten blade of grass in a field.</p>

<p>Having left Konsovka, I wandered for some time
about Moscow, where I made the acquaintance of
Count Orloff. Thence I went to Petersburg, and
tried to get some information concerning the
Rakitins, who were still living on the Oka.
Always hoping to get news of my faithless
Irena, I made many inquiries; but no one could
tell me what I wanted to know. My furlough
was not yet ended; I was free. But what was left
in the world for me? What could I do? What
could I undertake? Meanwhile, from the south,
from over the water, came news that was on
every one’s lips. It was the beginning of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Turkish war. A happy idea flashed through my
mind. I applied to the Board of Admiralty, and
begged to be transferred to the squadron then
sailing in Grecian waters. Count Feodor Orloff
helped me very much by giving me a letter of
introduction to Count Alexis, who was at that
time admiral of the fleet in the Mediterranean
Sea. How I came there and what I went through,
it would be useless to relate. Always repeating
the name that once was so dear to me, I threw
myself into every danger. I courted death at
Spezzia, at Navarino, and at Chesma. “Irisha!
Irisha!<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> what have you done with me! O my
God! put an end to my life!” I cried. But death
did not come. Instead of being killed, I was
taken prisoner soon after the glorious battle of
Chesma, and left in dreary captivity in Stamboul!</p>

<p class="tb">The mulla who visited me became more and
more friendly, but also more and more persistent.
We met every day, and had long conversations
together. Sometimes he made me very angry,
even mad, I might say; but at other times he
amused me. Then sometimes I would entice him,
for company’s sake, to defy the command of
the prophet, which, perhaps, a minute before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
had been teaching me with much fervour, by
taking a glass of wine with me; and would pour
the wine out for him myself. My teacher could
do nothing, of course, but try to please me, and
so very heartily began to partake of the wines of
Kioska, and others which he used to bring me.
Our meetings continued. We talked sometimes
of the Orient, of Russia, and many other things.</p>

<p>One evening&mdash;it must have been about the
middle of the year 1774&mdash;at the time when the
Muezzin<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> from the high tower began the call to
evening prayer, my teacher, with an air of great
mystery, and not without showing some wicked
pleasure, asked me whether I knew that there
had appeared in Italy a very powerful aspirant to
the Russian crown, a dangerous rival to the then
reigning Empress Ekaterina. I was very much
astonished at the news, and for some time was
unable to speak. The mulla again related his
story, and on my asking who the impostor was
he answered, “A secret daughter of the late
Empress Elizabeth Petrowna.” “That is all
nonsense and stupid gossip of your bazaars!”&mdash;The
mulla was much offended; his eyes sparkled
with passion. “No, not gossip,” he exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
as he took from under his robe a crumpled piece
of one of the newspapers of Utrecht. “You had
best be thinking of what awaits your native
land.”</p>

<p>My heart, which was beating so loyally for the
great empress then ruling over us, suddenly sank.
I read the newspaper, and became convinced
that the mulla was right. In Paris first, then in
Germany, and afterwards in Venice, a person had
appeared calling herself “Elizabeth, Princess of
all the Russias.” At the time of writing, this
adventuress was preparing to go to the Sultan,
to ask him to aid her with an army then encamped
on the banks of the Danube in enforcing
her claims. The mulla remained with me a little
longer, and then went out, casting a side glance
at me as he left the room. The news which I
had just heard troubled me very much. “How
so?” thought I. “Is it not enough that fate sent
us the horrible insurrection of Pougachoff?” of
which I heard in my prison, “and then the Turks?
Are we now to be troubled with this pretender?
The former burnt and desolated the whole Po-Volga;<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
this one wants to disturb the whole of
the south.” I was quite beside myself, and
strode from corner to corner of my cell. In my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
anger, I went up to my window, seized hold of
the grating, and shook it with all my might. I
was ready to tear it with my teeth. “Oh! for
wings! for wings!” I cried to God. I would have
flown to the fleet, told them everything, and
warned Orloff, who was so devoted to the
empress.… My prayers were answered in a
most marvellous manner. Never shall I forget
it, though I live for a century.</p>

<p>Devising a hundred plans for escape, my first
idea was to prepare some kind of key to loosen
my chains. On an earthenware pot I succeeded
in sharpening part of an old nail (upon which I
used to hang my clothes, and which I had taken
from the wall), and, after much painstaking,
fashioned it into a key. It is impossible to
describe my joy when, for the first night, I took
off my chains and went to bed without them.
Next morning I again fettered myself, and carefully
hid the key in a crevice in the wall. My
plan was this:&mdash;after having very quickly
loosened my chains, I would kill the renegade
mulla with them, and run away from the prison
without being seen. But where? Thus I planned;
but God, who holds our hearts in His hand, delivered
me from this sin. The mulla continued
to visit me and to drink the wine, which through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
his intercession had been provided for me in
abundance. At last my chance came. Having
chosen an evening, I decided upon telling the
mulla that, convinced by his wise teaching, I had
resolved to embrace the Mohammedan faith. He
was transported with delight, and in his joy partook
so heartily of the wine as to become intoxicated
and begin to doze. I kept refilling his
glass. “No,” he repeated continually, “I cannot.
I shall miss the prayers; I shall be denounced.”
But I again filled the glass, and he, blinking at
me knowingly, again emptied it, threw himself
on the floor, and beginning to hum a Bulgarian
song, was soon fast asleep. We were both about
the same height; my beard, which during my
imprisonment had grown very long, only differed
from his by being of a slightly lighter colour.</p>

<p>“Oh! good God! is it possible,” thought I, with
a thrill of joy, “that this is liberty at last?”</p>

<p>Drawing the enormous white turban over my
eyes, I devoutly bowed my head, and with silent
footsteps and the rosary in my hand, as if repeating
a prayer, I slowly left the prison, and crossed the
courtyard. The sentinels at the porches and the
gates of the mosque were walking silently backwards
and forwards with their muskets; but as
they did not recognise me I escaped detention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
For some time the noise of the street confused
me; I quite lost my senses. But I quickly recovered
myself, and hastening my steps, soon
reached the sea-shore. I signalled to one of the
boatmen, took my place in the first little boat that
approached me, and, bowing still lower, motioned
to the boatman to row me to one of the nearest
ships. It was a foreign one, as I had already
remarked from my windows. I saw now that it
was a French schooner, quite ready to sail, as I
could tell by her flag.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>I SEE THE PRINCESS.</i></span></h3>

<p>A dark, handsome, spirited Frenchman, the commanding
officer of the schooner, soon showed me
that he was a worthy subject of the nation to
which he belonged. Seeing in me a Russian
sailor, he looked at me, was silent a moment, and
then whispered, “Are you Konsov?”</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?” I asked, not
without some trepidation.</p>

<p>“Oh! how glad I should be if it were so!” he
answered, “for we all pity brave Konsov very
much, and constantly ask after him. I should be
very happy to be of any service to him.”</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done; and I concluded
it was better to reveal myself. The
captain was overjoyed; he conducted me to his
own cabin, and at once promised to pay the boatman;
whom, however, for safety’s sake, he first
ordered to be hoisted on deck with the boat.
The sails were then unfurled, and the anchor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
weighed. It was night when the schooner set
sail, and by morning we had left Stamboul far
behind us. The mulla must have slept soundly
and long, for we were not pursued. My boatman,
who was sent back from one of the villages we
passed, having received all that had been promised
him, and the mulla’s clothes in which I had escaped
into the bargain, was only too glad to hold
his tongue. The French officers gave me proper
clothing, and generously furnished me with a sum
of money, to which all had subscribed. They
politely offered to put me on board the first
Russian vessel we should meet in the Italian
seas.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I heard from the captain that the
mysterious Russian Princess was no longer in
Venice, but was now at Ragusa, past which town
we should have to sail. I asked to be put on
shore, but the French officers did all they could
to dissuade me, pointing out the risk I should run
in being again so near the Turks. This counsel
had no effect on me; I insisted on landing.</p>

<p>After having thanked my generous preservers
(who even refused to take my signature for their
loan), I soon set foot on the shores of the republic
of Ragusa, where I obtained information concerning
the lady who so deeply interested me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>This mysterious Princess had already conquered
the hearts of half the inhabitants of the town.
Much talk was going on. I found a great many
Poles and persons of different nationalities at the
hotel I had chosen, who formed part of the Princess’s
retinue. All these personages fought shy
of me at first, and showed great distrust, but on
learning who I was, and that, in my joy at my
miraculous preservation, I wished to go immediately
on board the squadron of Count Orloff, they
ceased to fear me, and without reserve began to
tell me all about the Princess. They even offered
to procure me an audience, if I wished it. “But
who is she? and where has she lived until now?”
I asked some of her followers.</p>

<p>“She is the daughter of your late Empress
Elizabeth, by a secret marriage with Count
Razoumovski,” was the answer. “In her childhood
she was carried to the frontiers of Persia,
and has since, under different assumed names,
lived at Kiel, Berlin, London, and many other
places. In Paris she was Dame D’Azov, and in
Germany and here in Ragusa she bears the title
of the Countess of Pinneberg. German princes
and others have wooed her, the French Court
assigned her apartments at their consul’s, and
were quite ready to give her aid and protection.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>All this troubled me greatly. “Kiel! Berlin!”
thought I. “Kiel is in Holstein. It played a most
important part in the history of Anna and Elizabeth,
the daughters of Peter the Great. Is it
possible that in Petersburg no importance is
attached to all this? What will be done when all
is known about this aspirant to the throne?”</p>

<p>The Poles then offered to take me to be presented
to the Countess of Pinneberg. I dressed
myself, trimmed my moustache and beard properly,
and powdered, perfumed, and curled my hair. I
met with every attention at the house of the
Countess. The Hofmarshall, Baron Korf, led
me into the reception room. I looked about me,
and noticed that the walls were tapestried with
blue silk brocade, and that the furniture was
upholstered in pink satin. All at once I heard
steps and a gay voice.</p>

<p>The Princess Elizabeth entered the room,
surrounded by a brilliant retinue. I learned
afterwards who these were. Her very devoted
friend, the celebrated Prince Radzivill, in a blue
velvet <i>kaftan</i><a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> literally blazing with diamonds;
near him his sister, the beautiful Countess of
Moravia, and the Princess Sangoushko. After
these came Count Pototski, in a beautiful red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
<i lang="ru">kountouska</i>,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> all embroidered with gold. The
count was then at the head of the Polish confederation,
our enemy. Next came the proud and
rich Starosta Pinski, Count Prgezdetski, and near
him stood the influential young confederate, the
famous duellist, Charnomski, with several of
Radzivill’s officers. Pototski and Prgezdetski
wore ribbons and stars. I noticed that the Princess
was dressed in an amazon of yellow silk,
with gold embroidery, and that it was covered
with black gauze; that she wore a small white
hat with black ostrich feathers, and a pink
mantle trimmed with blonde, and that at her belt
were a pair of very small pistolettes of magnificent
workmanship. She held a riding-whip in
her hand, for she was just going to start for a
ride on horseback. The proud Polish magnates
addressed the Princess as “Altesse,” and when
she sat down, remained standing; and in answering
her questions bowed so low that they almost
seemed to be kneeling.</p>

<p>I must confess that the Princess greatly impressed
me. I saw before me a beauty of the
first order, between twenty-three and twenty-four
years of age, taller than the generality of
people, graceful, slender, with lovely auburn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
hair, a very fair skin, beautiful pink cheeks, and
a few freckles, which rather suited her style of
beauty. Her eyes were hazel, very large and
open; one of them rather squinted, and thus gave
her an arch and playful look. But, what was
far more important, as a child, and later on as a
youth, I had often looked upon the portraits of
the late Empress Elizabeth; and now on examining
the Princess closely I was struck by the likeness
to them.</p>

<p>The Princess noticed my confusion with evident
pleasure. Saying a few gracious words to
me in French, she gave me her hand to kiss,
and having received me with all the ceremony
etiquette exacted, with a look dismissed her
retinue, and motioned me to a chair. We were
alone.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>MY INTERVIEW WITH THE PRINCESS.</i></span></h3>

<p>After having exchanged a few phrases&mdash;we
spoke French, but I noticed that the Princess let
fall many Italian exclamations&mdash;we both fell into
a most awkward silence.</p>

<p>“You are a Russian officer&mdash;a sailor?” asked
the Princess.</p>

<p>“Just so&mdash;Your&mdash;Serene Highness,” I answered,
hesitating a little, not knowing how to
address her.</p>

<p>“I know that you have highly distinguished
yourself. Your name made a noise in the world
after Chesma,” she continued; “and to crown all,
you have suffered a long imprisonment.”</p>

<p>I was greatly agitated, and remained silent;
she also paused. At last she began again, and
even though so many years have elapsed, I seem
to hear that low, charming contralto voice of
hers,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Listen,”&mdash;said she. “I am a Russian princess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the daughter of your once beloved empress. It
is true, is it not, that my mother, the daughter
of Peter the Great, was much loved? I, both
by blood and by her testament, am her only
heiress.”</p>

<p>“Yes. But you know,” I at last ventured to
say, “that there now reigns the no less beloved
Empress Ekaterina the Great.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” interrupted the Princess,
“how all powerful and idolized by her people the
present empress is; and it is not for me&mdash;poor,
weak, and abandoned by all, torn from the
Imperial house, and from the land of my birth&mdash;to
try to dispute the throne with her. I am the
most devoted of her slaves.”</p>

<p>“Then what are you seeking? what are you
expecting?” I asked with astonishment.</p>

<p>“Protection, and that my rights may be respected.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” I returned; “but you must first
prove your birth and your rights.”</p>

<p>“I have the proofs here,” the Princess replied;
and, hastily rising, she opened the drawer of a
Buhl side-table, with silver incrustations. “Here
is the testament of my grandfather, Peter I., and
this one is my mother’s, Elizabeth’s.”</p>

<p>The Princess tendered me a French version<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of the papers mentioned. I looked them over
hastily.</p>

<p>“But these are only copies,” said I; “mere
translations.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; but make your mind easy: the
originals are in safe hands.… How would it
be possible to carry such important documents
about with me; the risk would be too great,”
answered the Princess, turning her head a little
from me. Then she moved to the other side
of the room, where, in heavy gilt frames, hung
two oil paintings: one a remarkably good copy
of the portrait of the late Empress Elizabeth
Petrowna, with a small crown upon her head;
the other that of the Princess now standing
before me.</p>

<p>“Do you see the likeness?” she said, looking
at me.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, there is a likeness. I noticed it as
soon as I came in,” I answered. “Allow me to
ask how long ago that portrait was taken?”</p>

<p>“This very year, at Venice.… The celebrated
Piacetti painted my intended bridegroom’s
portrait, the Prince Radzivill’s, and begged to
be allowed to paint mine at the same time.”</p>

<p>“Mysterious coincidence!” I exclaimed, with
uncontrollable agitation; “we see things past all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
imagining. The dead rise out of their graves.
There beyond the Volga the Emperor Peter III.,
buried in the face of all the nation;<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> here, unexpected,
undivined, the daughter of the Empress
Elizabeth.”</p>

<p>“Do not, if you please, confound me with
Pougachoff,” answered the Princess, slightly reddening;
“although he gives himself out as the
Emperor, coins his money with the legend <i lang="la">Redivivus
et Ultor</i> (the risen Avenger), still, as yet, he
is only my lord-lieutenant in that part of the
country.”</p>

<p>“How so?” I answered, quite astonished.
“Then you also confess that he is an impostor?”</p>

<p>“Do not ask who he is,” mysteriously answered
the Princess; “afterwards you shall learn all;
the time has not yet come. He has already conquered
many towns&mdash;Kasan, Orenburg, Saratov&mdash;and
all the shores of the Volga. I know nothing
of his past. Let God be his judge; but I&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
am really and truly the daughter of the Empress
Elizabeth, and cousin to the Emperor Peter III.”</p>

<p>“But who was your father?” I ventured to
ask.</p>

<p>“Is it possible that you do not guess?” she answered,
slightly frowning. “Alexis Razoumovski,
who was married secretly to my mother. My
childhood I passed travelling from one place to
another; but it is quite indistinct even to me.
I remember a retired little village in the South
of Russia, from which I was carried off. They
would, if they could, have effaced from my mind
every remembrance of the past; and to that end
they lavished money upon me and took me
about from place to place. Count Shouvaloff, apparently,
was acquainted with the circumstances.
Not long ago, when travelling in Europe, he
expressed the wish to see me, and we met secretly.”</p>

<p>“What! you saw the Count Shouvaloff?
Where?” I exclaimed, amazed, as I recollected
that not a few people looked upon him as her
father.</p>

<p>“I met him at the waters of Spa.… Friends
warned me of that celebrated Russian traveller,
but I could not refuse him. I found him to be
an elderly person, rather stout, and bearing traces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of no common beauty. His dress was most
costly. He came to me under an assumed name,
and when speaking with me sorrowfully fixed
his eyes upon me and attentively examined my
features. I could see he was very agitated. I
learned afterwards that he was my late mother’s
favourite, Ivan Shouvaloff. I really cannot tell
why he looked so moved. It is not for me, of
course,&mdash;as you may well understand,&mdash;to say.
That secret my mother took to her grave, with
many others.”</p>

<p>The Princess was silent; I also.</p>

<p>“Whose protection, whose help, do you seek?”
I at last ventured to ask, troubled with so many
impressions.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>THE PRINCESS ASKS ME TO ASSIST HER.</i></span></h3>

<p>The Princess locked the paper in a casket, put it
away, took up a fan, and again sitting down,
began looking out of the window.</p>

<p>“Are you willing to help me?” she asked very
seriously, instead of answering my question.</p>

<p>I knew not what to answer.</p>

<p>“Are you willing to give me, should I need it,
every help in your power?”</p>

<p>“But what sort of help?”</p>

<p>“Well now, you see, should the Empress
Ekaterina be willing to act conscientiously and
without strife peacefully to divide the empire
with me,”&mdash;the Princess uttered this very slowly
and distinctly,&mdash;“I am ready to agree to anything
in reason. I will give up to her the
north, with Petersburg, all the Baltic provinces,
and all the province of Moscow. I shall retain
for myself the Caucasus&mdash;practically all the south&mdash;oh!
I love the south&mdash;and part of the west.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Oh! be quite sure I shall respect a peaceful
division. I shall be quite satisfied with the arrangement.
I shall people my dominions; I shall
arrange all in my own Fatherland. You will
see I am a <i lang="ru">masteritsa</i>.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> First of all, of course,
I shall arrange matters in Oukraine and Poland.
Of course you are from Oukraine?” she asked
me suddenly, fixing her eyes on me; “and I
passed my childhood there. In case Ekaterina
should not agree,” continued she, frowning, “of
course, nothing remains for me but to try the
force of arms. I intend going to Constantinople,
to the Sultan. He expects me. I shall lead his
army on to the Balkans, and on the borders of the
Danube shall meet the army of Ekaterina. Then
I will have my revenge. I shall find enough
people willing to help me; all the discontented&mdash;for
instance, the commodore of the fleet,&mdash;Orloff!
Eh! what do you say to that?”</p>

<p>“Orloff!” I repeated in amazement.</p>

<p>“Of course; he himself. You are astonished,
eh?” answered the Princess, fanning herself
and looking me boldly in the face. “Yes; what
do you say to that?”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Your Grace, but I cannot help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
speaking out my earnest conviction that all this
is but a child’s dream. On what do you found
your hopes of such&mdash;excuse me the expression&mdash;such
treason from the count?”</p>

<p>“Treason!”&mdash;cried out the Princess, suddenly
reddening; “but, of course, you must be excused.
You were so long a prisoner, there is a great
deal for you to learn”; and she contemptuously
smiled, nervously playing with her fan. “The
power and the influence of the Orloffs have
greatly fallen; their sworn and hidden foes, the
Pânins,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> are now in the ascendency. The empress’s
favourite, Gregory Orloff, allow me to tell
you, has been already replaced by another; he, in
his anger, broke off the negotiations begun with
the Sultan, and flew from the banks of the
Danube to Petersburg. But he was not received
at court, but exiled to Revel. Ah! you are
astonished. Well, learn still further. Your
chief, Count Alexis Orloff, his feelings as a
brother insulted, no longer hides his opinions:
he is ripe for revenge; and there is no doubt,
of course, that he can be very useful to me. You
see, what news! I have already sent a letter
to the Count Alexis, and a short manifesto.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“A manifesto! but what about?”</p>

<p>“If Orloff decides on taking my part, I advise
him then to proclaim my manifesto to the
fleet, take me on board, and stand up for my
rights.”</p>

<p>“But that is impossible. Excuse me,” I tried
to answer; “your actions are bold, but you have
not reflected enough.”</p>

<p>“Why do you think so?” asked the Princess,
astonished. “The malcontents are seeking revenge,
the forgotten recompense for their well-known
services. To Orloff alone&mdash;and that every
one knows&mdash;to him alone Ekaterina owes her
throne.”</p>

<p>The Princess rose, walked up and down the
room, and at last threw the window open. She
was nearly stifled. She began again explaining
her plan in its smallest details: how she hoped,
with the aid of the fleet, to invade Russia. She
would listen to none of my arguments. It seemed
as if nothing could convince her. It was plainly
visible that this capricious, spoiled, self-willed
woman, whose feelings burst forth like lava
hidden under ashes, thought she could measure
her strength with the most desperate of
men.</p>

<p>“You doubt; you are astonished,” she exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
with a nervous tremor. “You ask why
I believe in the success of my enterprise? Is it
possible that you do not know?… Already
many of your countrymen side with me; I am in
correspondence with numbers of them.…
But you&mdash;are the first Russian, the first really
worthy man, that I see throwing in your lot with
me.… I shall never forget the fact; it is
specially dear to me.… Believe me, I
shall rise victorious out of every difficulty;
the darkness <em>will</em> clear away.… Is it
possible that you do not know that Russia is torn
asunder by her battles, the pressgang for the
recruits, the fires, the plagues? Is it possible
you do not know that the country is worn out
with her taxations, that on the borders of the
Volga there rages a terrible, bloody insurrection?
Your army is badly clothed, and still worse fed;
… all are discontented, all grumble.…
You are not going to tell me that you, a lieutenant
in the Russian navy, know nothing of
all this? Yes, all the nation will hail me with
delight; the army will meet with joy a Russian-born
princess, Elizabeth II., just as they once
met Ekaterina.”</p>

<p>I was indignant at her childish and blind confidence
in herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, let it be so. Do you speak Russian?”
I decided on asking her.</p>

<p>The Princess blushed. “I do not speak it. I
have, of course, forgotten it, unfortunately,” she
answered, coughing. “In my infancy, when but
three years old, I was taken from Oukraine to
Siberia, where they nearly poisoned me; from
there into Persia, where I was placed with an old
woman in Ispahan, who took me to live in Bagdad,
where a certain M. Fournier taught me French.…
So it would have been rather strange
if I did remember my own language.”</p>

<p>I still continued sitting, my eyes fixed on the
ground. I could not raise them to her face.</p>

<p>“And Dimitri Tzarevitch,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> whom all Moscow
met so joyfully, did he speak Russian?” asked
the Princess contemptuously. “Besides, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
can languages prove? Children learn and unlearn
everything so easily.”</p>

<p>“Dimitri spoke with a ‘Little Russian’ accent,”
answered I. “And then, after all, he was but&mdash;a
pretender!”</p>

<p>“Gran Dio!” she exclaimed; and again coughing,
the Princess laughed. “And you’re not
ashamed of repeating those idle tales? Listen to
me, and remember my words.”…</p>

<p>The Princess threw herself back in her chair.
Bright spots appeared in her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Dimitri was the real tzarevitch.” She said
this in a voice of conviction. “Yes, the real
tzarevitch. He was saved from the hands of
the assassin Godounoff by the cleverness of those
around him, almost by a miracle, just as I was
saved from the poison they gave me in Siberia.
Ah! you did not know that? Yes, think about
it all a little more. Oh! Signor Konsov, tell
your tales to some one else, but not to me, who
have studied in a strange land the genealogy of
our house. The Shah of Persia offered his hand
and his throne to me, but I refused him; he is
the eternal enemy of Russia.… I <em>shall</em>
be acknowledged. Do you hear? They <em>must</em>
acknowledge me,” said the Princess, with great
dignity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Striking her knee with her fan, and beginning
again to cough, she continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I believe in the star of my destiny, and therefore
I choose you as my ambassador to Count
Orloff. I do not exact a speedy answer. Think
over it, weigh well my words, and then give me
your decision. You, again I repeat, are the first
Russian in an honourable military position whom
I have met abroad. You also have suffered, and
also escaped from prison by a miracle. Who
knows? perhaps Heaven saved you, like many
others, and sent you to me.”</p>

<p>Having said this, the Princess rose, and, with
a most majestic salute, signified that the audience
was concluded.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>I CONVEY A LETTER.</i></span></h3>

<p>“What does it all mean? Who is she? What
is she? A pretender, or a Russian grand
duchess?” thought I, as, full of contending
thoughts, I left the room of the Princess, and
with faltering steps passed between the persons
of her suite, who saluted me right and left with
the greatest respect.</p>

<p>At the <i lang="fr">perron</i><a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> I noticed several carriage-horses,
adorned with velvet and feathers. On entering
the hotel I heard the clattering of horses’ hoofs.
Going to the window, I saw the Princess, surrounded
by her courtiers, riding fearlessly on a
beautiful white horse. The cavalcade flew by on
the road to Ragusa.</p>

<p>For several days I could not get rid of the
most agitating ideas. I hardly left my room,
walking backwards and forwards, then lying down,
then writing letters, only, however, to tear them
up again, and constantly thinking, “How could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
I, remembering the oath of allegiance which I
had taken on entering the service? What ought I
to do regarding the proposition of this mysterious
Princess?”</p>

<p>One day her secretary, Charnomski, came to
pay me a visit. He was a smart, elegantly-dressed
man of about forty. He had once been very rich,
had been a duellist and a Lovelace, had lost all
his fortune at cards and in the affairs of the Confederation.
He had not lost his fine manners,
but was very conceited and insinuating, and&mdash;so
rumour said&mdash;was serving the Princess because
he was deeply in love with her. The conversation
turned on the Princess. He was eloquent
on the subject of her generosity, her fearlessness,
and, having assured me on oath that all
she had said of her past life was true, again
renewed, in her name, an entreaty that I would
side with her.</p>

<p>“But whose daughter is she? who was her
father?” I asked, rather drily. “You only speak
in her favour, but there must be proofs. Everything
is so very doubtful.”…</p>

<p>Charnomski reddened, and was silent several
minutes.</p>

<p>It seemed to me at that time that this
Princess’s Ganymede curled and pomatumed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the last fashion, with his diamond ear-rings, was
rouged.</p>

<p>“Good heavens! what doubts! Her father&mdash;do
you not know it yourself?&mdash;was the Count
Alexis Razoumovski,” said this wily diplomatist,
regaining his composure. “But if you desire it,
sir lieutenant, I can give you all the details.
You see, the Empress Elizabeth, after her secret
marriage with the count, had several children&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! all that’s nonsense; no one really knows
anything about it,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Of course it was a rather delicate affair, and
was kept a great secret,” continued Charnomski.
“You are right, how should every one know?
But I relate all this because I have it from
a true source. What became of the other children,
and whether any are still living, …
is not known.</p>

<p>“The Princess Elizabeth, when a child of two
years old, was brought to the relations of Razoumovski,
the Cossacks Daragan, to their property
in Oukraine, Daraganovka, which the neighbours,
countrymen of the new <i lang="fr">parvenus</i>, styled, in their
own fashion, “Tarakanovka.” The Dowager
Empress Elizabeth, and after her all the court,
in fun called the child the Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Tmoutarakanova.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> At first she was not neglected. She
was often inquired after. Everything that she
needed was always sent to her. But afterwards,
especially during her travels, she was lost sight
of, and finally quite forgotten.”</p>

<p>The word “Tarakanovka” made me shudder
in spite of myself. It sounded to me like a voice
of the past. It reminded me of my far-off childhood,
of our own little manor, Konsovka, and my
late grandmother, Agraffena Vlassovna, who had
known much of the past and present court; of the
wonderful luck which had fallen to the lot of the
shepherd of Lemechevski, who unexpectedly had
become, instead of the singer, Aloshki Razouma,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
a count, and the privately married husband of the
empress; of the accession to the throne of the
new empress; of the attempt of Merovitch, and
of many other events. Through him my grandfather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Irakli Konsov, who was a neighbour of
the Razoumovskis in the village Lemesha, was
loaded with favours, rose in his service, and died
in a very high position.</p>

<p>I remembered another very hazy circumstance.
I went once with my grandmother to a name’s-sake
day party given by some relations. Our
road lay across a village near Baturin, the residence
of the Hetman<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Kiryl Razoumovski. It
was a lovely and calm summer’s evening, and we
were talking together, grandmother and I. From
the open carriage, on both sides of the road, in
the twilight we could see the weeping willows,
and, scattered here and there between them, the
white cottages and windmills, and above the
willows and the cottages the church steeple.
My grandmother, musing quietly, crossed herself,
and then thoughtfully, gently, as if to herself,
all at once pronounced the word “Tarakanchic.”<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>“What did you say, grandmother?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Tarakanchic.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I will tell you, <i lang="fr">mon ange</i>,” she answered.
“Here, a long time ago, in this same
village, lived a mysterious person&mdash;a lovely,
graceful, and fair child, as fair as a lily; but she
did not stay long, and where she disappeared to
no one knows.”</p>

<p>“But who was it?” asked I.</p>

<p>“Red Riding Hood,” answered my grandmother,
lowering her voice. “I suppose, as in
the fairy tale, the cruel wolves have eaten poor
Tmoutarakanovka.”<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>My grandmother after this spoke no more, and
I, believing the wolves had really eaten the child,
forbore to ask any more questions.</p>

<p>But now I clearly remembered that lovely
green and willowy Tarakanovka and the mysterious
tale of my grandmother. That century was
rich in fairy-like lore, and one might be pardoned
for believing in all sorts of miracles.</p>

<p>“Well, have you decided, sir?” broke in Charnomski,
seeing that, lost in thought, I was silent.</p>

<p>“Explain to me just what the Princess expects
of me.”</p>

<p>“Only one thing, sir lieutenant, only one
thing,” answered the wily envoy, getting up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
bowing. “To take this letter of the Princess to
Count Orloff; that is the only thing she asks of
you.… Tell the count how and where you
met the Russian Grand Duchess Elizabeth, and
with what impatience she awaits his answer to her
first letter and manifesto. On the result of your
mission depends her further course of action
and her departure for the Sultan’s court.”</p>

<p>Charnomski took from his breast pocket a
letter, and handed it to me.</p>

<p>“That is her only request,” he repeated, bowing
again, and insinuatingly looking me in the
face, with a half-look of entreaty in his large
grey eyes.</p>

<p>After having thought it all over, I felt that I
ought not to refuse, and I took the letter. My
duty as an officer demanded that I should let the
count know everything. He must decide what
should be done; that would be his affair.</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered I. “I do not know
who your Princess is, but I undertake to deliver
her letter in safety.”</p>

<p>Having waited some time, I found an opportunity
of sailing to my destination. I presented
myself once more to the Princess, made my
adieux, and left Ragusa. The very same day
the Prince Radzivill gave, in honour of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Princess, his fairy-like and long-renowned fête.
For a long time in Europe the newspapers could
talk of nothing else. The extravagant and
generous prince, madly in love with the Princess,
had already been lavishing his wealth upon her,
like an Indian nabob; but this time he surpassed
himself. The fête lasted a long time; the most
precious wines flowed like water. There was
music, cannon were fired in the gardens, and a
beautiful display of fireworks of more than 1,000
rockets astonished all the town. At the end of
the feast, the knightly lover suddenly announced
that the dances would continue till the morning,
and that at dawn all the revellers, to refresh
themselves, should see a real winter, and should
drive home, not in carriages, but in sleighs.
On the morrow, when the guests came out on
the <i lang="fr">perron</i>, the neighbouring streets were really
quite white, and to all appearance covered with
snow. During the night busy workers had spread
a thick layer of salt over everything, and the
joyous, noisy crowd of <i lang="fr">masques</i>, amidst repeated
salutes of cannon and the shouts of the newly-awakened
citizens, were really driven home to
the musical sound of the sleigh bells.</p>

<p>I took my departure for Italy, puzzling my
brain with various questions. “Was this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Princess really the daughter of the Empress
Elizabeth? Did she believe in the truth of what
she said herself, or did she spread these rumours
on purpose?” As far as I could remember the
expression of her face, there appeared from time
to time, especially in her eyes, something it
seemed to me almost impossible to catch&mdash;a look
of indecision, mingled with a gleam of hope.</p>

<p>In taking with me her letter and the particulars
I had learnt, I was prompted by feelings
of duty, as an officer of Her Majesty Ekaterina,
but I was half won over by pity for the Princess
as a lovely and helpless woman.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>I DELIVER A LETTER.</i></span></h3>

<p>I landed at Ancona. From there I started for
Bologna, which I had heard the commander had
chosen for his headquarters. The Count Alexis
Orloff, although the hero of Chesma, hated the
sea from the bottom of his heart, and having
given over the command of the squadron to his
vice-admiral, the first flag-officer, Vice-Admiral
Samuel Greig, he spent most of his time on land.</p>

<p>To those beneath him he was ever amiable and
good. He was very fond of simple jokes, and
surrounded as he was by almost Imperial luxury,
was always attentive and easy of access. The
life of the count at Moscow, before the campaign
in the Greek waters, which had covered his name
with glory, had remained graven on my mind.
The Orloffs were no strangers to our family.
My late father in days gone by had been their
companion-in-arms, and I, in going backwards
and forwards from the naval schools to my
birthplace, used very often to spend long holidays
in their Muscovite house. The Count Alexis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
especially was a favourite of bright Moscow;
the gigantic and splendid figure of Count
Alexana, as all Moscow called him, full of robust
health, his fine Grecian eyes, his gay and careless
manners, his enormous wealth, all tended to
attract to his hospitable halls all that Moscow
could boast of as regards aristocracy, nobility,
and also almost all other classes.</p>

<p>The house of the Count Alexis, as I well
remember it now, stood not far from the gates
of Moscow, and not far from the “Crimean
Ford,” and very near to his property in the
environs of Moscow, the village Niaskouchnavo
(the “not gloomy” village).</p>

<p>The Muscovites could admire in the house of
the count the splendid gobelin tapestries on the
walls; the marvellous, graceful Dutch-tile stoves
on gilt pedestals; the magnificent collection of
old arms and armour. His town garden was
ornamented with ponds, lakes, arbours, cascades,
a menagerie, and an aviary. At the princely
gates, in one of the windows of the lodge-keeper’s
cottage, hung a golden cage with a parrot in it,
who would scream at the idlers, “Long live our
little Mother Empress!” At the fabulous feasts
of the Count Alexis, very often under the costly
lemon and orange trees, brought from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
hothouses, tables would be spread, at which
more than 300 people would sit down. A true
Russian at heart, the count used to like giving
his guests the pleasure of looking on at boxings,
wrestlings, minstrelsies, himself often not disdaining
to take part in them. With his hand he
could bend a horseshoe, tie a poker in a knot,
or catch a bull by the horns and throw him
down; and to these sights he would sometimes
invite all Moscow.</p>

<p>On one occasion, to have a good laugh at
the rising passion of the fops for <i lang="fr">pince-nez</i> and
spectacles, on the 1st of May he sent on the
public promenade at Sokolnika one of his attendants,
dressed in a riding costume, and leading
amongst the crowd of young dandies a poor,
crippled, and half-blind cur, with great <em>tin</em> spectacles
on his nose, and a card hung round his
neck with the following sentence in large letters,
“And look, he’s only three years old!”</p>

<p>But it was his splendidly arranged hunting
meets and horse races which made him a centre
of attraction to all classes of society. Not one
horse in all Moscow could be compared to his
“Rissak,”<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> a mixed breed of Arabian, English,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and Frisian horses. At the races held in front
of the house at the “Crimean Ford” I can even
now remember how the Count Alexano, in the
winter in his tiny sleighs, and in summer in
his racing <i lang="ru">droskies</i> would lead with his own
hands his spotlessly white horse “Smitanka,”
or her rival, the dapple-grey “Amazonka.”
Crowds would be running after the count when
he, gathering the reins in his hand in his
<i lang="ru">romanovski touloup</i>,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> or his damask coat, would
appear at the gates on his snorting, white-maned
beauty, calling out to his three Simeons&mdash;to
his first jockey, Sainka the White, to arrange
the bit; to his second, Sainka the Black, to
tighten the stirrups; to his third, Sainka the
Dresdenite, to moisten the horse’s mane with <i lang="ru">kvas</i>.</p>

<p>The count was also playful in his correspondence.
Who does not know the letter he wrote
to his brother Gregory after the celebrated victory
of Chesma?</p>

<p>“Sir, my brother, good day! We marched on
the enemy, we went up to him, we caught him,
we felled him, we broke him, we conquered him,
we drowned him, we burnt him, and turned him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
into ashes. And I, your humble servant, am in
good health.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Alexis Orloff.</span>”</p>

<p>Copies of this letter were in the hands of
every one. A born jester, a reveller, a boxer, this
pleasure-loving count in his young years before
the war had never even dreamt of being a
sailor. Even to take the command of the fleet
in Italy he went by land! He was very much
talked about on the accession of the empress to
the throne; after the battle of Chesma he was
still more talked about; but to a good many
he remained an enigma. At the reviews and
parades, at his own princely <i lang="fr">levées</i>, Count Alexis
always appeared surrounded with great pomp,
covered with gold, diamonds, and orders of all
sorts; but in his walks in Paris he would go out
amongst the elegant and fastidious crowd of
promenaders sometimes with his head unpowdered,
with a little round <i lang="fr">bourgeois</i> hat,
and a coat of the coarsest and commonest grey
cloth. I, of course, like others, could not very
well guess the motives which prompted him to do
all this. Very often even his words would bewilder
you. Yes, he was a man of great mind
and subtle wit. I burned with impatience again
to see him, after so long a separation, although
the commission entrusted to me by the Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
troubled me very much. Before my departure
from Ragusa I had let the count know
by letter of my escape from the Turks, and also
that I was bringing him news of a very important
person, whom I had discovered by accident and
had met.</p>

<p>My journey through Italy lasted a long time. I
managed to get a chill on the mountains, fell ill,
and was obliged to stay for some time at the
house of a charitable magnate. At length I
arrived at Bologna. After having rested from
my journey a little, I changed my dress, and,
feeling rather agitated, I approached the beautiful
palace of the count at Bologna. I learnt that the
count was at home, and sent to announce my
presence. After my long imprisonment, I had
every reason to expect a warm welcome and
reward; but I was rather doubtful how the
count would take my audience and conference
with the dangerous and mysterious pretender,
held without the permission of my chief. There
were two sides to the question. If I had been
asked to say conscientiously exactly what I
thought of the Princess, I should have found
it very difficult to give a truthful answer. At
Ragusa I had heard many doubtful things of her
past life, about mysterious ties she had formed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
But what did her past life matter to any one?
Who knows what ties she might have been induced
to make to escape from her gloomy fate?
And who knows if such ties really existed?</p>

<p>The count received me directly. I was led
through a long suite of richly-decorated drawing-rooms
and salons, first on the ground-floor and
then upstairs.</p>

<p>At this time the handsome hero of Chesma,
Count Alexis, was in his thirty-eighth year. Not
only at home, but in a strange land, he loved to
spend his time with doves, being passionately fond
of these birds. On my arrival he was sitting at
the very top of his house, where he ordered the
footman at once to bring me. What a sight met
my eyes! This celebrated man&mdash;so clever, so
strong and so stately, before whom all other men
seemed but pigmies&mdash;was seated on a common
wooden chair at the dusty little window. Having
run away from the heat, he was seated with only
his shirt on! and was drinking out of a mug
some iced wine, at the same time waving his
handkerchief at a brood of doves, who were
pirouetting about the roof. “Ah! Konchic;<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> how
are you?” said he, turning for a minute towards
me. “Well, what? run away, eh? Well, congratulate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
you, old fellow. Sit down. Oh! look
there; are they not a lovely couple? What do you
think of them? Ah! the rascals; there they are
turning and twisting. Ah, <i lang="fr">tourmelins</i><a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> ah!”</p>

<p>Again he waved his handkerchief, and I, not
finding any chair to sit upon, began looking at
him with curiosity.</p>

<p>The count in these last years of peace had
grown stouter, his neck was quite like a bull’s,
his shoulders like Jupiter’s or Bacchus’s, his face
quite striking, with its look of health and dauntlessness.</p>

<p>“Well! what are you staring at?” said he,
standing and looking at me. “I was amusing myself
with birds, while you were sitting with the
Turks. Here they are all clay-coloured and black,
but the tuberous ones, like ours, old fellow, are
few, and not common. Yes, they can take letters
for a longer distance than 100 <i lang="ru">versts</i>. Marvellous!
If we could but breed them in Russia! Well now,
tell me everything about the prison and about
the travels.”</p>

<p>I began my narration. The count listened to me
at first very inattentively, all the while looking
out of the window, but afterwards he grew more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
interested; and when I touched upon the subject
of the person whom I had met at Ragusa, and
handed him the letter, the count threw a handful
of seed from a plate at the assembled doves, and
when they all flew off in a crowd up on the roof,
stood up.</p>

<p>“This news, my dear fellow, is such that we
must talk seriously. Let’s get down from this
mast into the company cabin.” We went downstairs
and afterwards into the garden. The count
on the way had dressed himself, and given orders
that no one was to be received. We walked a
long while backwards and forwards in the
avenues. While I answered his questions I
looked attentively into the expressive and often
dreamy eyes of the count. He listened to me
with very great attention.</p>

<p>“Ah! art scheming?” said he, all at once;
“why, suppose she is a pretender, an adventuress.
Now explain,” added he, sitting down on a bench.
“Art repeating the words of others or thine
own?”</p>

<p>I felt confused, and did not quite know what
to answer.</p>

<p>“All the tales of her past life are so strange,”
said I, “so much like a fairy-tale&mdash;Siberia, poison,
escape from Persia, correspondence with all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
crowned heads of Europe&mdash;that I have conscientiously
acted as a faithful servant of the
empress, looked well about me, as I cannot, I
must say, hide my doubts.…”</p>

<p>“Agreed,” said the count, “Of course, you
can look at it in two ways; but the most important
fact is that <em>she</em> is known of at St.
Petersburg. They have written to me about her,
speaking of her as a ‘vagabond,’ who has taken
to herself a name and genealogy to which she
has no right.”</p>

<p>The count was silent for some time.</p>

<p>“H’m! nice vagabond!” added he, as if to himself.
“Puzzling, of course. Let it be so; I do not
dispute it.… But why have they decided on
exacting her extradition? and, in case it should
be refused, on taking her by force, even if it is
necessary to bombard the citadel of Ragusa? No
one acts like that with a common vagabond. Such
a person you just catch&mdash;a stone on the neck and
in the water.”</p>

<p>I felt as if cold water were running down my
back at these words of the count. I vividly
remember that eventful June day.…</p>

<p>“Well, what, old man&mdash;you see yourself it’s no
vagabond&mdash;what do you think about it? No,
straight out with it, hide nothing.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>WE WILL BEFRIEND HER.</i></span></h3>

<p>The words of the count filled me with astonishment.
Involuntarily I remembered then the
intelligence the Princess had given me of the
fallen favours of the Orloffs, of the exile of the
late favourite to Revel, and of the rising fortunes
of their enemies. Was it grief, was it passion
which blinded the count? or did he really
believe in the descent of the Princess? I really
did not know, but I could clearly see that he was
not throwing his words to the winds, and that a
great struggle was taking place in his heart.</p>

<p>“Excuse my impertinence, Your Grace,” said
I impatiently, “but if you bid me, I’ll hide
nothing from you. The person I saw, I must
say, resembles very much the late Empress Elizabeth.
Who does not know the portrait of that
empress? The same imposing profile, the white,
delicate complexion, the same dark arched eyebrows,
the same majestic figure, and, more important
than all,&mdash;the same eyes. I cannot help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
relating to you what my late grandmother in
Oukraine told me about the relatives of the
Razoumovskis.”</p>

<p>“Ah! bah! But yourself, Konsov&mdash;you are
from Baturin!” excitedly said the count. “Well,
well, and what did your grandmother tell you?”</p>

<p>I told him all I knew about Daraganovka, and
about the mysterious child who had once lived
there.</p>

<p>“Ah! that’s where this Tarakanovka comes
from,” said the count. “True! true! Yes! yes!
I remember now I heard something about a
Tmoutarakanski<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> princess.”</p>

<p>He rose from the bench. I could see that he
was very much agitated. Crossing his hands
behind his back, and with his head hanging down,
he began walking backwards and forwards on the
garden path. I respectfully followed him at a
little distance.</p>

<p>“Konsov, you are now no longer a boy!” said
Alexis Gregorevitch, turning his keen eagle eyes
upon me. “This is a most important State affair.
Be careful, not only of your actions and your
words, but even of your very thoughts. Can you
swear to be silent on everything?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your Grace, I give you my oath.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, listen, and&mdash;remember&mdash;you answer
me with your head.”<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The count stopped, and his thoughtful gaze
seemed to pierce my very soul; then he added,
“Don’t forget; you know me of old&mdash;your
head!…”</p>

<p>We crossed the garden, and sat on an isolated
bench.</p>

<p>“Of course it will not be very difficult to catch
this calumniated person,” said the count; “you’re
obliged to do a great deal sometimes, when you
are ordered to do it. But would it be honest
now? What do you think about it?&mdash;Mysteriously&mdash;deceitfully?
Ah! and especially with
a woman.&mdash;It would be a pity now, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Of course it would,” answered I, in my simplicity;
“of course we must conquer our enemies;
but then openly&mdash;otherwise everybody will have
the right to call us traitors, soul-killers.”</p>

<p>At this minute the eyes of the count twinkled
very curiously. He closed them quickly, as
though something had blown into them.</p>

<p>“Of course, of course, old man, it would be
mean.… You and I are not executioners,”
said he. “Of course they wouldn’t write from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Petersburg for nothing; and then, who knows
what they think about us there? But there now,
I’ll be open. I received two secret envoys from
over there, tempting and inducing me to turn
traitor.… Could I expect such a thing?
Isn’t it an insult, after all my long years of faithful
devotion? Ah! what think you of that?”</p>

<p>The frankness of the count struck me with
astonishment, and flattered my vanity. “What
a lot falls to the great of this earth!” thought I
and from the bottom of my heart I pitied the
count, whose fallen greatness I knew already.</p>

<p>Alexis Gregorevitch put several questions to
me about the Princess and her <i lang="fr">entourage</i>, told
me he would employ me as adjutant, and dismissed
me with the order to go to Bologna and
await his commands. I thanked him for his
attention, and took my leave.</p>

<p>The next day the count left for Livorno<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> to visit
his squadron, and remained away a whole week.
As I was without any money and in great want
of everything, it was not very pleasant for me. I
had no one to write to in Russia. Several more
days passed. At last I was summoned.</p>

<p>The count received me in his study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can you guess, Konsov, what I’ve to tell
you?” he asked me, arranging some papers.</p>

<p>“How can I guess the thoughts of Your
Grace?”</p>

<p>“Here’s a note. Go to the purser, get some
money, pay your debts. Send the money to those
French creditors. You’ve ruined yourself in the
service. To-morrow you go to Rome.”</p>

<p>I bowed, and awaited further orders.</p>

<p>“Do you know why?” asked the count.</p>

<p>“I cannot guess.”</p>

<p>“Whilst you wandered about and were ill,
this mysterious Princess, deserted by the volatile
Radzivill,” said the count, “left Ragusa. At first,
with a Neapolitan passport, she went to Barletta,
lived there some time. Now she has appeared in
Rome as a Polish lady. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>I again bowed.</p>

<p>“Well, now,” continued the count, “I am very
culpable in her eyes. I have not answered her
two letters. But how could I, surrounded by all
these spies? Answer? I tried once or twice to
send her a faithful emissary, one of your own
companions-at-arms, but she would not receive
him. I pity that poor, young deserted thing, so
inexperienced and without any means. You’ll
be able to see her and begin the negotiations. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
have invited her here; at Rome, I have heard,
there are several Russians. Try and get to know
everything that’s going on; but, first of all, shield
her from all enemies and all foreign influence.
Let her believe in us alone. We will befriend her.
About your own conscience, be easy; all shall be
done in all mercy and according to the laws of
justice.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>IS THE COUNT A TRAITOR?</i></span></h3>

<p>I was overwhelmed; I was wonderstruck.</p>

<p>“Is it possible the count can be a traitor?”
The thought flew like lightning through my brain.
Impossible. Celebrated patriot, celebrated hero
of the <i lang="fr">Coup d’État</i>,<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> right hand of Ekaterina?
Such thoughts would be unworthy. But what in
the world is he plotting? Agitated by different
doubts, suddenly a bold and almost insolent plan
came into my head&mdash;that of learning the most
secret designs of the count. It is true that in
these last few days a rumour had been circulated
to the effect that from the north had been received
a secret <i lang="ru">ukase</i>, that the count, for whom the
deepest regret was felt, had been recalled, and
the command of the fleet given to another.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Your Grace,” said I to the count;
“to-morrow I start for Rome. You have confided
to me a mission of the highest importance. In
case the Princess should agree to your conditions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and should accept your invitation, what will be
the result of it all, if I may presume to ask you?”</p>

<p>“Oh! what a fireship!<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> what a leech!” said
Alexis Gregorevitch, with a curl of his lip.
“Yes, and you sailors are all like that. Take
out everything, and spread it on the table. But
we diplomâts do not care for useless prattle.
Live, and then you’ll know. This affair will show
itself. But I am the true and faithful servant
of our Empress Ekaterina Alexéevna.”</p>

<p>“Be generous, and forgive me, count,” said
I. “You have confided to me, not a naval
mission, but a diplomatic one. It has never
happened to me before, and therefore I am very
doubtful.… And should this person assert
her rights?”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s just what I’m thinking about.
It might easily be that she is a branch of the
Imperial family. In her veins flows perhaps the
blood of our mother Elizabeth. We must be ready
for anything. Do all you can, Konsov; your
services shall not be forgotten. But don’t forget
one thing. You must help the Princess with
money, as she is a woman. You must take her out
of her humiliating position.… Who knows?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
perhaps to her Imperial Majesty it will not be
disagreeable. Our reigning sovereign has a
heart. Oh! sometimes it is a stone.… Who
knows? perhaps in time it may be softer.”</p>

<p>The count astonished me more than ever.</p>

<p>“Well,” thought I to myself, “what an honour
for me to have won the confidence of such an
exalted personage! All is clear now. The
count is no traitor. Although his ambition, perhaps,
led him to murmur, still.&mdash;The favour of
the Orloffs is fallen, and it’s evident the count
wishes to persuade the Princess to give up her
rights.”</p>

<p>The whole plan, explained to me by the count,
became quite clear. Having prepared everything
for my journey, I took my departure, with the
most faithful resolution to fulfil the mission which
had been confided to me.</p>

<p class="tb">It was in the month of February, 1775, not
so very long ago for me to have suffered and
experienced so much. Having reached Rome, I
made inquiries about the emissary of the count
who had reached Rome before me. He was a
lieutenant of our own squadron, and, as some
said, a Greek. To me it seemed more likely
that he, Ivan Moisaevitch Christianok by name,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
was half German and half Jew. I handed over
to him the papers that had been confided to
my care, and began questioning him about our
mutual mission. As black as a beetle, small of
stature, restless&mdash;in fact, a most repulsive man&mdash;Christianok
smiled continually, spoke always in
a most insinuating voice, and seemed, with his
shifting glance, to dive at once into one’s soul
and one’s pocket.</p>

<p>I learnt from Christianok that the Princess had
taken a few rooms in Rome, on the first floor of
the house of Juani, on the Champs de Mars.
She lived there in the greatest retirement and in
great want. She paid for her apartment fifty
<i lang="fr">sequins</i> a month, and kept only three servants.
She only went out to go to church, and, excepting
one friend, a Jesuit <i lang="fr">abbé</i>, and the doctor who
attended her, she saw no one. The emissary of
the count, Christianok, disguised as a beggar,
lounged about the house of Juani for more than
a fortnight, trying in vain to get a glimpse of its
fair inhabitant. But he was mistrusted by every
one, and, notwithstanding all his efforts, his entreaties
to the servants, no one would let him in.
He took me to the Champs de Mars.</p>

<p>The house of Juani was very solitary; it was
built quite apart, between a yard and a not very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
large but very shady garden. I went up to the
door and raised the knocker. First I saw at the
window, which was framed in creeping vines, the
maid of the Princess, daughter of a Prussian
captain, Francis Mecèdès, and after her the
secretary of the Princess, whom I had seen at
Ragusa, Charnomski.</p>

<p>“From whom?” asked the latter timidly,
looking at me from behind the half-open door.</p>

<p>I hardly knew him again. Where was his
<i lang="fr">aplomb</i>&mdash;his foppery? where had it disappeared?
His clothes were half worn out, his hair was
uncurled, there was no rouge on his cheeks,
and he wore only the commonest and cheapest
of ear-rings!</p>

<p>“From Count Orloff,” answered I.</p>

<p>“Have you a letter?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but let me in.”</p>

<p>“Have you a letter?” repeated the secretary,
already taking an insolent and bragging tone.</p>

<p>“Yes, in the writing of the count himself,”
answered I, handing him the letter.</p>

<p>Charnomski tore it out of my hands, glanced
at the German superscription, and, quite bewildered,
slowly retreated, and disappeared.
After a few minutes the door was quickly opened,
and I was let in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah! <i lang="fr">mille pardons!</i>” said Charnomski, bowing
very low; “now just fancy, I didn’t know
you again in your uniform, you are so changed.
Welcome, thrice welcome, long-expected and
wished-for guest!”</p>

<p>He turned and twisted and smirked so much
that I could not help at once pitying and laughing
at him.</p>

<p>The Princess received me in a very small room,
the windows looking out on to the silent and
deserted garden. There were now no splendid
damask walls, no gilt furniture, no bronze&mdash;in
one word, not one of the luxuries which there
had been at Ragusa. She herself, the Grand-duchess
Elizabeth Tarakanova, Princess Wladimirskaya,
Dame D’Azow&mdash;she who had captivated
the Shah of Persia and German princes&mdash;was now
lying ill on a leathern sofa, a blue velvet mantilla
thrown over her, and her feet encased in fur
slippers. The room was cold and damp. A log
of wood was flickering dimly in the fireplace,
shedding no warmth anywhere. I did not recognise
the Princess. Her thin and wan face,
with the hectic flush in each cheek, seemed more
lovely than ever. Her eyes smiled, but they
were not the same; they reminded me of the
eyes of a beautiful wild fawn, mortally wounded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
escaping the chase, but feeling that her end is
near.</p>

<p>“Ah! you are come at last!” said she timidly,
smiling. “You have brought the answer to my
letter from the count.… I have read it.…
Thank you.… What have you to
tell me?”</p>

<p>“The count is your most obedient servant,”
answered I, repeating the words that had been
said to me. “He is quite at your service and at
your feet.”</p>

<p>The Princess rose. Arranging her beautiful
fair wavy hair, which she wore without powder,
she put out her hand with a timid, friendly
gesture. I ventured to raise it to my lips.</p>

<p>“Here all, excepting two persons, have deserted
me,” said she; but her strong convulsive cough
interrupted her. She put a handkerchief to her
lips,&mdash;“and then, added to that, I fell ill;&mdash;but
all that’s nonsense,&mdash;it’s not worth speaking about.
But do you know now that I’m quite without any
means? The Prince Radzivill, his friends, the
French people who helped me, have all deserted
me, have all hidden themselves,&mdash;and all that
happened so unexpectedly,&mdash;so quickly.…
Hardly was peace signed with Turkey when my
<i lang="fr">complaisant</i> Polish magnates one and all threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
me off. Never mind; I’ll pay them out for that
some day. But now, … I must tell you
openly,” added she, smiling, “I am quite, yes, <em>quite</em>,
without money. I have not one single <i lang="ru">baioch</i><a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>&mdash;I’ve
nothing to pay the doctor, or to procure
provisions, with. My creditors give me no peace:
threaten me with the police. It’s awful; I’ve
nothing left to live upon.…”</p>

<p>Having said this, the Princess began again
to cough most awfully, and fixed upon me her
supplicating, bewildered glance;&mdash;of her former
confidence not a trace remained.</p>

<p>“Your Highness,” said I, fulfilling my instructions,
“the count has sent you this small
sum. How much there is here I know not,
but the count offers it to you with all his
heart.”</p>

<p>I handed to the Princess a small packet,
sealed with the count’s crest, and containing a
cheque on a Roman banker, Jenkins. She read
the paper, passed her hands over her eyes,
looked me in the face, and again began coughing.</p>

<p>“Is it possible?” she exclaimed, with a happy
smile, pressing the paper to her heart; “it is true
then&mdash;it is not a hoax?”</p>

<p>“Such exalted and important personages as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
His Grace the Count Orloff never joke on such
subjects,” answered I.</p>

<p>The Princess all of a sudden jumped up from
the sofa, clapped her hands like a child, and with
tears and smiles threw her arms round my neck,
screamed out something I could not make out,
and ran out of the room.</p>

<p>From there I could hear her scream, “Unlimited
credit!” and then, all at once, I could
hear her hysterical sobs. The servants began
running to and fro; Charnomski, pale and agitated,
came into the room.</p>

<p>“Her Highness is so grateful to you,” said he,
pressing my hand with emotion. “You are the
first to help her, the first who has kept his word.
It is so rare now: the Princess had every reason
to hesitate; she has been so often deceived.
Yes, my countrymen enticed her here, and then
deserted her.… The count invites her to
come to Bologna. Whether she will consent or
not, I do not know; but we must hope that she
will decide to accept the invitation of the count.
She is fearless, enterprising, as brave as a
chevalier; and to reach the aim so dear to her
heart, believe me, she will fear nothing.”</p>

<p>“May I let the count know this?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Wait a short time&mdash;in her position&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
then, as you see, ill,” answered Charnomski;
“pass again in two or three days, we will let
you know. <i lang="fr">En attendant</i>,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> keep all secret.”</p>

<p>“But there are other Russians here,” I answered,
“who see the Princess. They may injure
her. Who are they?”</p>

<p>Charnomski flushed to the very roots of his
hair, looked embarrassed, gave me a side-long
glance, and answered that he knew nothing about
that.</p>

<p>I took my departure. Several days passed,
but still I knew nothing of the Princess. We
took it by turns, Christianok and I, to watch the
house from one of the neighbouring restaurants,
noticing who went in and out, and awaiting further
events.</p>

<p>For the first two or three days all in the house
was as quiet and solitary as usual. The doctor
came several times, then a woman dressed all in
black, covered with a long black veil, to all
appearance a nun. She always used to remain
a considerable time with the Princess. One
evening a servant of the house brought up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the <i lang="fr">perron</i> a very handsome hired carriage; a
woman wrapped in a blue velvet mantilla came
out with tottering steps, and took a seat in the
carriage.</p>

<p>“The Princess!” said I, to Christianok. “We
must follow and find out where she goes.”</p>

<p>We called a cab,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and followed her. The carriage,
its blinds drawn down, rapidly passed
through several streets, bowled out into the
Corso, and drew up at the door of the banker
Jenkins. All was clear now; the magical key,
the count’s cheque, had opened the door to the
confiding and fearless beauty.</p>

<p>Another week passed, and still no news of the
Princess. I had caught cold, and was obliged
to keep indoors, but Christianok, who alone now
watched the house, told me with great indignation
that we had been made fools of, and nothing else;
the Princess did not even think of going to
Bologna. She had, as the emissary learnt, paid
all her debts; the creditors and the police, who
had threatened her with arrest, had been tranquillized,
and had therefore left her at peace.</p>

<p>The house of Juani had wonderfully altered.
Before the <i lang="fr">perron</i> all day and late at night stood
a whole crowd of carriages. The retinue of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Princess had again increased; she had taken the
two floors of the vast house of Juani, and had
ordered herself splendid toilettes. Again, as
before, she was to be seen constantly driving
out, visiting museums, galleries, paying and receiving
visits: she kept open house.</p>

<p>At this very time Rome was especially lively;
the new Pope was to be chosen in place of the
late Clement XIV. In the evening the salons of
the Princess were filled with the most celebrated
painters, musicians, <i lang="fr">littérateurs</i>, and high clergy.
The “Unknown” in the black dress had not
been seen for a long time. Once I had met her
at the door of the house of Juani. On seeing me,
she turned away impatiently, and, did I dream
it?&mdash;said something in Russian. I just caught
a glimpse of golden hair streaked with grey, and
the angry flash of splendid grey eyes. The
windows of the Princess were often open, and
through them were heard the strains of the harp,
on which she played artistically. A whole crowd
of loiterers and beggars, always expecting her
generous gratuities, surrounded the house from
morning to night, and we could often hear them
noisily applauding the splendid cavalcades of the
Princess. I had quite recovered now, and could
see for myself the Princess, as before, heedless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
gay, now riding a spirited charger, flying like
the wind along the squares, in the streets, now
driving in an open carriage; always merry,
always laughing. Involuntarily I felt glad for
her, poor young thing, having, through me, because
of her sex, found help and support in her
dark days. One thing alone vexed me. Christianok,
who had been given to me as an assistant,
began to hint at the possible want of candour of
the count towards me. Rome began to talk of
the lovely Princess, just as Venice had talked, and
even&mdash;though in the last days so bitter against
her&mdash;Ragusa. Christianok, somehow or other,
learnt that the banker Jenkins had paid her in
the name of the count 10,000 ducats. The revived
beauty spent the money she received with
a lavish hand, never thinking that some day it
would come to an end. I was once invited to
one of her <i lang="fr">soirées</i>; the Princess seemed a radiant
sun among surrounding stars. She played on the
harp with such feeling, that I was deeply moved.
Of her departure, however, she said nothing.
She merely remarked once, <i lang="fr">en passant</i>, “Be
easy; it will be all right.”</p>

<p>At the end of a few days, on the advice of
Christianok, I wrote her a letter, reminding her
of the count. The answer was very long in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
coming. We were lost in conjectures. At last
I received a note from her, inviting me to meet
her in the Church of Santa Maria dell’ Angela.</p>

<p>It was evening. I went silently into the dim
church, which was filled with the odour of incense.
Here and there flickered a taper before
the picture of some saint. A mysterious silence
seemed to fill the deserted obscurity of the
columns and <i lang="fr">prie-dieux</i>. In the loneliest corner,
behind a high <i lang="fr">prie-dieu</i>, with a prayer-book in
one hand, stood, wrapped in a very elegant mantilla,
a tall slender figure, veiled&mdash;I recognised
the Princess.</p>

<p>“The wish for the welfare and happiness of
my fatherland, and future subjects,” said she,
bending her head over her prayer-book, “is so
strong in me that I have decided to accept the
invitation of the count. Before, he frightened
me; I did not believe him. Now I have full
confidence. You see, I have kept my word. To
all my friends I have said that I am bidding
adieu to the world; that for the rest of my life
I am shutting myself up in a nunnery.&mdash;To you
I will say something else.…”</p>

<p>She lingered, as though gathering strength.</p>

<p>“To-morrow I take my departure,” said she,
in a dignified voice; “not for a convent, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
with you for the Count Orloff’s. You will not
deceive me; you will not betray me?”</p>

<p>I silently bowed. What could I answer? I,
the faithful subject of her Imperial Majesty.
The eyes of the Princess were filled with exultation&mdash;with
hopes. She knew no doubts, no
distrust. Before me stood a woman deeply convinced.
Pity for her involuntarily stole over me.</p>

<p>“And so till to-morrow, and then, <i lang="fr">en route</i>.…”</p>

<p>“Well, thank God, at last,” thought I, “the
count will now be able to convince her; he’ll
arrange matters for her.”</p>

<p>She shook me warmly by the hand; seemed
as though she wished to add something, then
rapidly disappeared. I also directed my steps
to the church porch. As I approached the vessel
of holy water, a woman standing there stepped
forward and stood in front of me. I recognised
the person in black whom I had seen entering
the house of Juani.</p>

<p>“Konsov,” said she, in an indignant whisper
in Russian, pushing me aside behind one of the
columns; “you&mdash;you are a traitor.”</p>

<p>“How dare you say that? Who are you?”
asked I. “If you are Russian, tell me your
name?”</p>

pointed to the image of the Virgin Mary.</p>

<p>“I can only repeat what I have already said,”
I whispered. “The Princess is safe, and a more

<p>She shook my hand, bowed, and silently left

<p>I followed her as far as I could with my eyes,
trying to guess who she was, and why she took
so profound an interest in the Princess.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>THE DEPARTURE FROM ROME.</i></span></h3>

<p>It was the 12th of February. The day was very
cold and northern-like, but withal very bright.
The Princess, her suite and servants, took their
seats in several carriages. At the Church of San
Carlo she distributed rich alms to the poor, and
then, followed by a whole crowd of artists and
nobles, and amidst the cries and shouts of the
populace, who ran after her, waving hats and
caps, she left Rome. At the town gates, she
signed her name in the books as Countess Selinski.
She took the Florentine route.</p>

<p>I galloped in front, while Christianok followed
closely behind her.</p>

<p>On the 16th of February the Princess arrived
at Bologna. The count was not in town; he was
awaiting her in his more retired palace of Pisa.</p>

<p>The noisy train and crowd of servants following
the Princess, and amounting to several dozens
of people, exceedingly astonished the count. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
he received his visitor very respectfully and
cordially, appointed her a splendid apartment, not
far from his own, surrounded her with every
comfort possible, and at all times conducted himself
as a most faithful subject, never even, before
strangers, sitting down in her presence. Strange
things began to happen. What the count said
to the Princess, what negotiations passed between
them, no one of course knew. We could only
surmise&mdash;as we did very soon&mdash;that a most
hazardous game of love was being played. And,
indeed, the Princess soon afterwards removed
from her own apartment to that of the count,
while her retinue and servants remained where
they were. Christianok, ever since the arrival
of the Princess, constantly tried to put me in the
shade. He exalted his own services, as though
the whole success of the plot was due to him
alone. Of course my pride would only allow
me to look upon all this with contempt. The
count could see for himself that it was to my influence
alone that he owed the arrival of the
Princess.</p>

<p>Rumours began to circulate that Alexis Gregorevitch
had made the Princess many presents;
that among other things he had given her his
own miniature, painted on ivory and encircled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
with precious stones; that for her he had, even
from the very first, deserted his much beloved
favourite, the lovely and amiable wife of the rich
Alexandre Lvovitch Davidoff, a born Orloff.
There remained no doubt. The enchantress had
won the heart of the count, our <i lang="fr">preux</i>. The
lion had fallen in love with a gay butterfly.
Dazzled by her, the count no longer made a
secret of his passion. He was to be seen openly
with her everywhere&mdash;on the promenade, at the
opera, or at church: it was all the same. One
day the Princess did me the honour to call me.
She began asking me about this and about that
and assured me several times that she had more
confidence in me than in any one else. The
count also was always most amiable. Christianok,
seeing me again in favour, had recourse to a little
ruse. The cunning Greek began to complain
that the Princess had been very sparing in her
attentions to him at Rome, and that he could not
forget it; she therefore, with the permission of
the count, gave him a colonel’s brevet. I was
passed by. I bore this injustice without a murmur,
relying on the confidence reposed in me by
the count and the Princess, of which I was soon
to have proofs.</p>

<p>“Well Konsov!” said the count to me one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
day, “honour and glory to you, who have known
so well how to procure me the opportunity of
making myself agreeable to such a person. We
must prepare for her, in the future, a quiet and
comfortable life. Is she not, truly, a lovely
creature? What a lively and charming character!
I must say, candidly, I’m almost ready to marry
her myself, and have done with my bachelor
life.…”</p>

<p>“Well and why not, your Grace?” answered
I. “What should there be to prevent it?”</p>

<p>“She won’t consent, old fellow; she says, ‘I’ll
consent only when I’m in my proper place.’”</p>

<p>“How so? Excuse me, I don’t understand.
What proper place?”</p>

<p>“Oh! well, cannot you understand?…
When she will be in Russia, at home,&mdash;well,
when the empress will condescend to recognise
her rights.”</p>

<p>“But is there any hope of that?”</p>

<p>Orloff became thoughtful.</p>

<p>“Well, I think,” said he, “that it might be
possible; I hope her friends will not spoil everything.
They follow her so closely here, all those
Poles, those Jesuits of all kinds. Who knows?
They may poison us. They may shoot us; or
give us a stab at the corner of the street with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
a hired <i>Kinjal</i>.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> All they desire is a person for
their disturbances.”</p>

<p>The count seemed very much agitated. His
frank, open and intelligent countenance seemed
troubled. The passion of his heart, working as
it were against his will, could be heard in his
trembling voice, in each of his words.</p>

<p>The day ended. The count did not leave his
visitor for a minute.</p>

<p>“Here’s bad luck! she won’t listen. Really I
don’t know what to do,” said he, one day, having
summoned me. “If I could find some one to
help me, … some one who could persuade
her.…”</p>

<p>“Persuade her to what?” I asked.</p>

<p>“To a private marriage, and then flight.…”</p>

<p>“But with whom?”</p>

<p>“With me!…”</p>

<p>“What! your Grace! but where to?”</p>

<p>“To the end of the world, if need be.…
Ah, yes, while I think of it, persuade her not to
carry pistolets on her person; the other day, in
a passion, she nearly killed her own maid, Francesca.…”</p>

<p>Having uttered this confession, this athletic,
this splendid Apollo-like count, stood before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
me as flushed as a schoolgirl, and his eyes were
cast down, just as if he were some love-sick youth
awaiting his sentence.</p>

<p>What answer could I make him? In my
agitation I was silent; but then, as always, I
decided to remain his most devoted and obedient
servant. After all, what was it? A marriage.
There was nothing bad in that. In marrying her
the count was only obeying the dictates of his
heart, and while gaining in position by allying
himself with Imperial blood, he was transforming
the “Adventuress” into the modest Countess
Orloff.</p>

<p class="tb">Here I must interrupt my narrative, and return
to the present&mdash;to our poor frigate. My
God! how awful! Tempest-tost, the <i>Northern
Eagle</i> for five whole days was borne no one
knew whither. All the reckonings, all the
fathomings were being done in vain. To-day, at
dawn, we passed Spain, not far from the African
coast and near some wild stony islands. We
made signals, but in the fog no one could see us.
In the daytime, having finished my watch, I
remained on deck. A most unbearable, sultry
coast-wind, a boundless expanse of water, splashing
between the rocks, a ship without mast or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
compass, universal despair, and not the least hope
of being saved: that is all we have before our
eyes. The first reef, and we are lost. Irena,
oh! far-off charming traitress! oh! could you
but see all the torments endured by the poor
rejected exile! Night, again a calm. I’m once
more in my cabin. All-powerful God, give me
only the strength to live through this night and
finish writing my tale.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>THE PRINCESS SEEKS MY ADVICE.</i></span></h3>

<p>The exhausted commander sleeps soundly. Only
the sentinels and I are on watch. I shall begin
now to relate the saddest experience of all my
life. This experience is the principal excuse for
my writing this confession. May she who caused
me to wander, an exile in a foreign land, remember
that she was the involuntary participator in that
action which will remain a source of regret and
reproach to the end of my life.</p>

<p>It was at Bologna, to which place the count
had removed.</p>

<p>The Princess had desired to see me. She kindly
invited me to be seated, and took a chair herself.
I noticed again those two hectic spots on her
cheeks, that her eyes were literally glowing, and
that she seemed quite beside herself.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant, I sent for you to confide in you
a secret,” she said, throwing an anxious glance
around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am all attention, your Highness, and you
may trust me,” I answered.</p>

<p>“The count starts to-morrow for Livorno.
Did you know it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered.</p>

<p>“You see, there has been a quarrel there, and
a fight between some English and Russian sailors,
and the count wishes to invite his friend, the English
consul, a Mr. Dickson, to settle the matter.”</p>

<p>“Well! what about that?” I said. “That’s
nothing important; it will soon be arranged, and
the count will return.”</p>

<p>“He has asked me to go with him.…
What if I refuse? If I don’t accompany him?
What do you think? He’ll not desert me, as all
the others have done, and disappear for ever?”</p>

<p>“Oh! but why not go?” answered I, following
the idea of the count. “It’s a simple promenade.
Why not accompany the count? The weather
is splendid. It could only be a pleasure trip for
you both.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered thoughtfully, “I should
very much like to see the town and your fleet;
the count praises his sailors so highly.”</p>

<p>“Well, and what is there to prevent your
going?” I said thoughtfully. “Yes,” I said to
myself, “it would seem that the count is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
persistent. He won’t leave her alone for a single
instant.”</p>

<p>“Ah! yes! I was forgetting,” said the Princess,
as though collecting her thoughts.</p>

<p>Looking at her, I could see that her eyes were
full of tears, her lips trembling, and that, though
looking at me, she seemed not to see me.</p>

<p>“Listen!” she said reluctantly. “You’re an
honest man.… The count has made me an
offer of marriage&mdash;has proposed to me. What
do you think of it?”</p>

<p>I rose respectfully.</p>

<p>“Allow me to congratulate you from the bottom
of my heart,” I said earnestly, bowing. “Your
merit has triumphed over everything. But there
is nothing wonderful in that.”</p>

<p>“But will he not deceive me? Will he not
betray me?” whispered the Princess, again
glancing around.</p>

<p>Her very lips were blanched; she was quite
beside herself.</p>

<p>“Tell me the whole truth, I implore you! You
see, following his advice, I carry no arms upon
me; it offends him.…”</p>

<p>It flashed through my mind that just during
this very journey the count might persuade her
to marry him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“But, your Highness,” said I, and those fatal
words burn now in my brain like letters of fire,
“what do you fear? The count is madly in love
with you, that I know surely. He sleeps but to
see you in his dreams; even, he wanted to fly
away with you.”</p>

<p>“Then it is the truth? Swear by the memory
of your mother, of your father,” said she, squeezing
my hand with all her might.</p>

<p>“In the name of God, it is true! I heard it
from his own lips. He honoured me with his
confidence. Besides, what am I in his eyes?
Nothing; the meanest servant, the merest cipher,
… and yet he told even me openly.…”</p>

<p>The Princess fixed her eyes on the image of
the Saviour crowned with thorns hung up in the
corner of the room, and she remained motionless
for several minutes, as though breathing a silent
and fervent prayer.</p>

<p>“The brave alone live!” said she, rising and
drawing herself up to her full height. “Once
his wife, he cannot betray me.… I shall
go.… But, remember, I’ll not give up
either liberty or heart without a struggle.…
What is to happen will happen soon.…”</p>

<p>I again heartily congratulated the Princess.</p>

<p>“Ah! another thing, Konsov,” she said, stopping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
me. “Tell me truly, in all conscience, as
before God, is it this same Orloff who helped your
empress to obtain the throne?”</p>

<p>“The very same.”</p>

<p>“How brave! how gallant! what a hero!”
said the Princess, with animation. “Fearless
Cid! Bayard! A spark of God’s Spirit gives
such men their bravery and their fearlessness.”</p>

<p>I went away full of joy at the successful issue
of our plan. Still I had certain misgivings.
“Does the Princess know of his other feat?
Why did I not tell her of that other dark, unpardonable
sin?” I was only faithful to my
duty, obeyed the orders of my superior, but could
not help pitying the woman.</p>

<p>Heavy doubts overwhelmed me, and all night
I could not shut my eyes. “Duty is duty, but,
if&mdash;? Should I go to-morrow morning,” whispered
my conscience, “and warn her? There’s
time; let her think well, weigh everything, and
then decide.”</p>

<p>When dawn broke, I got up, dressed, and
hastened to the house of the count. Before
the house quite a crowd of people had collected.
Carriages were driving to and fro. I made my
way through the throng. The count and Princess
had already taken their seats in a carriage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Christianok was seated in another. Some of the
servants occupied a third.</p>

<p>“Make haste, Konsov! Take your place. We
were only waiting for you!” Unconsciously almost
I took my place by Christianok.</p>

<p>The train started. After the heavy rain, the
morning had emerged into a beautiful calm.</p>

<p>“What do you see in all this?” Christianok
asked me, when we had fairly started.</p>

<p>“In what?”</p>

<p>“Well, in this little <em>voyage</em>?”</p>

<p>“I really do not know, and dare not guess,” I
answered.</p>

<p>“Well, to-morrow there will be a bridal couple,”
he said, and smiled. “They’ll be married.”</p>

<p>“But where’s the church?”</p>

<p>“What is the Fleet church for? They’ll
get on the Admiralty ship, and there be spliced
in a trice. But of course it was only for that she
consented to go.…”</p>

<p>“Then it <em>is</em> true?”</p>

<p>“Well! don’t you see it yourself? The count
seems to be on wings; it seemed too good to be
true. So, you see, the fairy tale will soon become
a true event.”</p>

<p>At Livorno, the Count Orloff was met by the
commander of our squadron, Admiral Samuel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Carlovitch Greig. Afterwards the count and
Princess paid him a visit, and then called on the
English consul, drove out with him, his wife, and
a whole circle of visitors into the country, and
then went for a sail in boats with music; everywhere
they were followed by a curious mob. In
the evening of the second day of their arrival
at Livorna, the count and the Princess went to
the opera. On their return, I noticed in the
vestibule of the splendid marble palace assigned
to the count another intriguing Greek also
serving in our fleet, Joseph Michaelevitch Ribas,
or, as he called himself, De Ribas. He also somewhat
resembled Christianok, being as black as a
beetle; but being taller and not so nimble, we
used to call the pair of them the Beetle and
Cockchafer. De Ribas, as I afterwards learnt,
had been engaged even sooner than I or Christianok,
having been sent to Venice to collect
information about the Princess.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, priest,” said the count to Ribas,
laughing and not noticing me. “Mind, don’t
forget the vestments.”</p>

<p>“Vestments, … and why priest?” I
stood under the marble colonnade bewildered,
lost in thought, hardly seeing the lovely blue
boundless sea and our squadron.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>THE “MARRIAGE.”</i></span></h3>

<p>The 22nd of February was lovely, almost like
summer in its warmth, not a cloud in the skies,
the sea calm as a mirror, a holiday feeling in
the air. The English consul had invited the
count and Princess, and all their suite to
luncheon. The Princess arrived, splendidly and
tastefully dressed, and, as always, gay and lively.
Where was her illness? She chatted merrily
with the other guests. On the terrace, adorned
with flowers, she walked, carelessly laughing and
joking. Every one showed her the greatest
attention and respect.</p>

<p>Count Alexis Gregorevitch was a model
<i lang="fr">cavalier-servant</i> of the Princess, holding her
fan and her gloves, and taking from the hands
of the servants the cool refreshing drinks, to
offer them himself to her. All noticed that his
amorous glances followed her everywhere, and
that she seemed born to new life. As by magic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
her languor had disappeared; her <i lang="fr">preux chevalier</i>,
the tamed lion, was at her feet.</p>

<p>“Ha! our Celadon, what think you of him?”
whispered Christianok. “Yes, resting on his
laurels of Chesma, the hero does not disdain
another conquest!”</p>

<p>Admiral Greig, by nature of a very taciturn
disposition, took no part in the conversation, but
sat a little apart, extremely stern, sad of countenance,
and with downcast eyes, seeming to
notice nothing.</p>

<p>Some one walked up to the window. From
there you could see the blue sea and the Russian
flotilla. The ladies began talking of pleasant
sails on the sea.</p>

<p>“Well, count! show us your ships,” said the
Princess. “In Civita Vecchia you showed them
the mock-fight of Chesma; you gave others
pleasure, honour us also.”</p>

<p>“All is ready,” answered Orloff, bowing respectfully.</p>

<p>The whole party went down to the sea-shore.
Count Alexis Gregorevitch was specially respectful
to the Princess. He himself placed her shawl
on her shoulders, and taking her parasol from
the hands of her maid, opened it, and, walking by
her side, shielded her from the sun, all the while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
whispering in her ears the most passionate protestations
of love.</p>

<p>The whole crowd of spectators collected on
the sea-shore looked admiringly at his general’s
uniform of dark green with red facings, all
covered with gold embroidery, which adorned
his splendid figure, and on all sides we could
hear cries of “<i lang="fr">Vivat</i>,” mixed with whispers of
“Oh! what a couple!”</p>

<p>They all took their places in the boats and
barges standing ready by the sea-shore. The
Princess seated herself in a splendid gilded
barge, ornamented and arranged with imperial
luxury. The wives of Admiral Greig and of the
English consul took their places by her side.
The count went with the Admiral, and I with
the retinue of the Princess. The barge floated
in the direction of the Russian flotilla. We were
received by the squadron with the greatest pomp.
Flags waved everywhere. The officers in their
brightest uniforms stood at their posts; the
sailors at the masts. From all the ships floated
the most delicious music. The waves gently
rocked us. The receding shore was covered with
spectators.</p>

<p>As we touched the admiral’s ship, the <i>Three
Hierarchs</i>, a splendid gilt arm-chair was let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
down, in which first of all the Princess was
pulled up, and then the other ladies. We
mounted the trap. The ladies had hardly
stepped on deck, when from all sides came cries
of “Hurrah!” and cannon were fired. The sight
was splendid. The spectators in the streets and
on shore merrily waved their hats and handkerchiefs.
All were in high expectation that Orloff
would conduct the manœuvres, and, to make the
illusion more complete, would burn some old
useless ship. A great many glasses were pointed
at us from the shore. Dozens of little boats,
filled with onlookers, started from the shore in
the direction of our ship. On board the <i>Three
Hierarchs</i> there seemed to be great commotion.
The whole staff of the admiral’s servants were
running to and fro, with trays loaded with wine,
bon-bons, and fruit. There was dancing in the
saloon. The younger gentlemen and ladies were
dancing with all their heart the <i lang="fr">contre-danse</i> and
<i lang="fr">cotillon</i>. The wives of the admiral and consul
surrounded the Princess with little attentions.</p>

<p>The ladies were soon invited into a special
cabin, where presently they were joined by the
count and the admiral, who were busily talking
together. The latter seemed quite out of sorts,
and very gloomy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“They are going to marry the count and the
Princess,” I heard one of the officers whisper to
another.</p>

<p>I was dumbfounded.</p>

<p>“But why here?” asked the one to whom the
question was addressed. “Why all this mystery,
all this haste?”</p>

<p>“There’s no Russian church here. The admiral
has lent his, and that accounts for the Princess’s
arrival at Livorno, and her presence on board.”</p>

<p>After a little while the decks began to be
deserted, and many of the suite, getting into
the barges, were rowed back to land, amongst
others, the two cunning and clever Greeks, Ribas
and Christianok.</p>

<p>On seeing them, I do not know why, there
flashed through my mind the words of the count
to Ribas,&mdash;“Priest and vestments.” In the meantime
there were no clergy to be seen on board.
The deck was becoming more and more deserted.
The officers were walking backwards and forwards,
gaily chatting and pointing their glasses
at the occupants of the boats. The band played
a very gay march, and then an aria from a well-known
opera.</p>

<p>What took place below all this while has remained
a mystery. Several asserted afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
that nothing particular had occurred, but that
at table the betrothal of the count and Princess
had been solemnly announced, and that all had
drunk the health of the bridal couple. Others
on oath protested that in another cabin there
had been a mock marriage between the count
and Princess, so that Orloff, in her eyes at least,
might seem to be keeping his word, and that
in this sacrilegious ceremony the <i lang="fr">rôle</i> of Priest
and Deacon had been played by Christianok
and Ribas, who were dressed up in the vestments
of the clergy of the fleet, the first acting
the part of deacon, and the second that of
priest.</p>

<p>But I am running on too fast; let us return to
the deck of the <i>Three Hierarchs</i>.</p>

<p>My strength fails me; my heart bursts; the
pen falls from my fingers when I recollect all
that I was so soon to see.</p>

<p>Wherever I shall be,&mdash;if I remain, by a miracle
of God, alive, or if I am destined to perish in the
waves,&mdash;the remembrance of all that I then saw
will only be effaced from my mind with my last
dying groan.</p>

<p>The deck was full of life. All had left the
cabins, and were now sitting in detached groups;
there was laughing and talking on all sides;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
servants were running to and fro, with cooling
drinks and wine.</p>

<p>The Princess was leaning over the side of the
vessel. The wind was rising; it was getting
cool. She called me to her side with a friendly
nod. I helped her to put on her mantilla.</p>

<p>“If I live a hundred years I shall not forget
this,” she whispered, with a happy smile, shaking
me warmly by the hand. “You have kept your
word. All is being fulfilled. I shall soon be in
Russia, and once there&mdash;why not hope? They
will proclaim the future Empress Elizabeth II.…
Oh! now is the time for wonders. The
present empress, what was she a little while
ago?”</p>

<p>Those words filled me with astonishment. I
was silent, bewildered by the wild fantasies of
this poor blinded creature.</p>

<p>On board the <i>Three Hierarchs</i> they hoisted a
signal flag. Again the roar of the cannon was
heard, mingled with the cries of “Hurrah!” The
bands on all the ships again began playing; the
flotilla was beginning its manœuvres. Enchanted
by all this attention on the part of her future
subjects, the Princess, still leaning against the
side of the ship, seemed plunged in agreeable
thought, as her eyes followed the curling smoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
from the shots and the movements of the different
ships.</p>

<p>I see her now, as she then stood, in her blue
velvet mantilla, a small black straw hat, and a
white parasol in her hands.</p>

<p>I also was lost in thought. Yes, all is finished
now! The count has found a companion for
life. He will know how to persuade her. Together
they will fly to the feet of a merciful
empress.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>TREACHERY.</i></span></h3>

<p>“Your swords, gentlemen!” resounded a most
loud and commanding voice near me.</p>

<p>I glanced round. Captain Litvenoff addressed
himself by turn to all the adjutants and others
in the count’s retinue, demanding their swords.
The deck was covered with armed sailors. Admiral
Greig, his wife, and the consul were nowhere
to be seen. Quite bewildered, I surrendered
my sword, as did all the others. The Princess,
hearing the clatter of arms and loud words,
turned rapidly round. She was as pale as death;
she had taken in the situation at a glance.</p>

<p>“What does all this mean?” she asked in
French.</p>

<p>“In the name of the empress, you are arrested,”
answered the captain.</p>

<p>“Violence! force!” screamed the Princess.
“Help,&mdash;here,&mdash;to me!”</p>

<p>She rushed to the trap, forcing her way with
her feeble hands through the ranks of armed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
men. The sailors, sunburnt and sullen, looked
at her in astonishment. Litvenoff stopped her.</p>

<p>“Impossible!” said he. “Be calm.”</p>

<p>“Perfidy! Malediction!” madly cried she.
“How dare you&mdash;with a woman&mdash;with a Russian
Princess. Do you hear? Let me pass,” she
cried to the soldiers in French. “Where is Count
Orloff? Call him here. Bring him here. You
shall answer for all this!”</p>

<p>“The count, by order of the empress and
admiral, is also arrested,” answered Litvenoff,
respectfully bowing. “He is arrested just as you
are!”</p>

<p>The Princess gave a loud scream, and drew
back.</p>

<p>Her reproachful glance fell upon me. It seemed
to pierce my heart like a dagger, as though saying,
“It is your fault. You have ruined me.”</p>

<p>She staggered back a few steps, and then
fainted away.</p>

<p>The sailors carried her into the cabin. All
the servants, except her maid, who remained with
her, had been arrested, and under a strong escort
had been transferred to another ship.</p>

<p class="tb">Shattered in my innermost soul by all that
I had seen, I recovered my senses to find myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
in a small dim cabin. Lifting up my head, I saw
that I was shut in with that dastard Christianok,
the principal author of our misery, the perpetrator
of the treachery. I cannot say what
astonishment I showed. My comrade, at all
events, was very calm. He was lounging, and
eating some bon-bons he had snatched up from
the table, and glancing from time to time at our
closed door.</p>

<p>“You’re astonished?” he asked me. “Is it
not true? What wonderful things! Yes?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s enough to be astonished at!” I
answered, concealing my disgust with difficulty.</p>

<p>“It was impossible otherwise,” said he.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because only the bait of marriage could
tempt this adventuress.”</p>

<p>“Yes! but why play with her feelings, with
her heart?” said I, impatiently.</p>

<p>“We should never have got her on board
otherwise.”</p>

<p>“There were many other ways. I know myself
that the count promised her on his oath to
marry her, and that once his wife, she would
have trusted herself with our fleet.”</p>

<p>“Ah! my dear Konsov, what simplicity!”
chuckled the cunning knave. “Is it possible you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
have not yet guessed? Why, at the very moment
when the count was playing with the Princess
at the most tender protestations of love, I was
writing under his dictation, and in his name, a
letter to the empress, telling her that he had
decided to do everything to catch the adventuress,
and even, if need be, to tie a stone to her neck,
and throw her into the river.”</p>

<p>“And why didn’t you straightway drown
her?” I cried out, scarcely knowing what I said.
“It would have been far more merciful than
to deceive the poor unfortunate, consumptive
creature.…”</p>

<p>“She’ll live long enough, yet,” said Christianok.
“The orders were to catch her quietly,
cleverly, without any noise. That’s just what we
have done.”</p>

<p>I heard these cold hard words with the greatest
indignation. I was almost beside myself at the
heartlessness of the wily Greek.</p>

<p>“No! enough, old man. Calm your knightly
feelings; that’s all bosh. In our time, remember,
the most important thing is courage, and impudence
itself must be clever and sharp. Success
means might and riches; non-success, poverty,
or what is worse, Siberia. No, you had better
get up. Don’t you see that it’s time?…”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Raising my head, I saw that our door was
open, and through it I could see the whole crew,
walking to and fro, and talking gaily. The
Greek and I were taken into the ward-room.
There on the table stood a whole battery of wine
bottles. The room was filled with the fumes of
tobacco and punch. We were forced to drink,
and then sent on shore. There I learnt that
the count had all this time been with the admiral
at the consul’s, discussing their future
movements.</p>

<p>In the evening the streets of Livorno were
filled with turbulent and indignant crowds. The
Russians shut themselves up in their houses.
Involuntarily I grasped my hat and cloak, and
taking the most deserted streets, proceeded to
the sea-shore.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>REMORSE.</i></span></h3>

<p>I fell down on the shore. Oh! my God! what
anguish! Tears blinded me. Sobs stifled me.
I hated, I cursed the whole world. “How,”
thought I, “could such a dastardly, godless deed
be perpetrated, and I all the while a partaker in
the crime?” My whole frame shook with indignation,
with madness, as with horror I turned
over in my mind every little detail; thought over
all the disgusting and dastardly meanness, the
fiendish calculation, the treachery of him to
whom I had been so faithful and so devoted, and
who had not scrupled to sport with that most
sacred feeling&mdash;love. I could fancy to myself
at that very minute that poor deserted woman,
half killed with misery. I could picture her in
my mind sitting in her dark prison, her soul torn
with anguish; who knows, perhaps chained and
watched over by coarse, brutal soldiers. “And
when did all that take place?” I repeated to
myself. “When all seemed so smiling, when all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
her golden dreams seemed ready to be fulfilled.”
The obscure daughter of the late empress had
seen at her feet the highest dignitary of the new
empress. The whole fleet had met her with
cries of joy, with roars of cannon. What must
she have felt? what must she have experienced?
From under the rock where I was lying I could
see the lovely sunset, gilding with its last rays
the top of the hills, the crosses on the town
churches, and, fading almost entirely, the outlines
of the ships at sea. “Oh! infamy! infamy!”
I whispered. “Count Orloff has sullied
his soul with an action still darker than all the
rest. No laurels, not even the laurels of Chesma,
will now be able to shield him from the justice
of God or man. And also, according to our
services, shall justice be meted out to us&mdash;his
accomplices in that dark deed.”</p>

<p>My despair was so strong that I was ready to
have done with life.</p>

<p>“No; repent all thy life, repent,” seemed to
whisper an inner voice. “Search for means to
redeem thy dark crime.”</p>

<p>A gun was fired from the flag-ship, and on all
the other ships nearer were heard the strains of
the vesper music, and then the prayers rose on
the still air. The sable veil of night descended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
on the sea; on the guard-ship, and along the
shore, the watch-fires began to be lighted. I
rose, and, hardly able to drag my feet along,
crawled home. There I found the orderly of the
count waiting for me. I followed him.</p>

<p>“Well! Konsov! now confess you were a little
astonished,” said the count coming to meet me.</p>

<p>My tongue clove to the roof of my mouth.
Well, what could I have said in answer to him?
He, gifted with all the blessings of life; this <i lang="fr">preux</i>
chevalier; this dignitary, brave, bold, daring,
courageous, loaded with honours, a short time ago
my idol, was now to me loathsome, unbearable.</p>

<p>“Do you think that I don’t remember? that I
have forgotten?” he continued, avoiding looking
me straight in the face. “Oh! I know well that
for the most important part I am indebted to you.…
Had it not been her faith in you, and
in your interest, it would not have been so easy
to cage the bird.…”</p>

<p>The words of the count literally stung me. I
stood confused, bewildered.</p>

<p>“But, perhaps you do not know, you have not
heard,” as if to console me, said the count&mdash;“do
not take on so&mdash;we had received from Petersburg
the most formal and detailed instructions concerning
this usurper, this person who had taken to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
herself a name and lineage not belonging to her.
The order was to arrest her at any cost, and
bring her there. Well, now have you understood?”</p>

<p>In my confusion and trouble I could make no
answer.</p>

<p>“The Pretender is now in our hands. The will
of our Sovereign has been fulfilled, and the
prisoner will soon sail for the north. There’ll
be enough inquiries set on foot; they’ll dig
down to the very roots.… All that’s not
the work of foreigners alone. I think there’ll be
mixed up in this not a few of our own travellers.
In the papers of that liar there are not a few
well-known signatures.…”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re rejoicing; there’ll be again new
arrests, again inquiries,” thought I. “And yourself,
what did you do, stony-hearted man?”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you say something?” asked the
count.</p>

<p>“The whole town is in agitation; there are
mobs, screams, threats. Have a care, count,” I
added, unable to conceal my disgust; “this is not
Russia.… You might get a stab when
least expecting it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well, my fine fellow,” said he frowning,
“whoever touches you or any other of ours, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
even threatens, just point to the sea.…
Seven hundred cannon, all sweeping the whole
shore. I’ve only to raise my hand, and the whole
town will be level and clear. There, go now,
and tell every one that, and add that I fear no
one.…”</p>

<p>“Braggart!” thought I to myself, shivering
with rage.</p>

<p>I left the count without opening my mouth,
and without even a bow.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>THE BOTTLE CAST INTO THE SEA.</i></span></h3>

<p>Several wretched, unbearable days passed.
Livorno really rose, and began to threaten us
with an open attack. The indignant populace by
night and by day surrounded the palace of the
count, and from time to time threw stones at the
building. The count was protected by a bodyguard
of sailors. Boats filled with ladies and
gentlemen were constantly sailing between the
ships to try and catch a glimpse of the unfortunate
prisoner. I was sent on board the <i>Three
Hierarchs</i> with a letter and parcel of books which
had been confided to me by the count, as I learnt
afterwards, for the Princess. As I was returning
to the shore I heard a cry, and turning round,
was petrified. At the open window of the <i>Three
Hierarchs</i> I could see, pressed to the iron grating,
a pale countenance and a hand waving a handkerchief.
I also answered by waving my hand.
Was it noticed or not from the ship, behind the
high waves? I never knew. The sailors plied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
their oars sturdily; there was a strong breeze,
and the boat flew on the dancing waves.</p>

<p class="tb">Rumours began to circulate that the fleet
would soon set sail. Where for was not yet
known.</p>

<p>I got ready to go out and learn, if possible, if
I was to remain on the Count’s staff. I was just
taking up my hat, when some one entered the
room. I turned round. At the door stood a
dark figure. On looking at her, I recognised the
Russian stranger of the Church Santa Maria.</p>

<p>Her travel-stained dress showed she had just
come a long journey.</p>

<p>“You recognise me,” said she, throwing back
her veil, and I could see that her golden, wavy
hair had become grey.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” I asked her.</p>

<p>“That’s how you answered for her. Those
are your promises,” said she, advancing a step
towards me. “Where are your assurances, your
word of honour as a true man?”</p>

<p>“Listen to me.… I am innocent,” I began.</p>

<p>“Dastards! ruffians!” she screamed. “They’ve
laid a trap, they’ve enticed her, they’ve ruined
the poor unfortunate, and then, think <em>you</em>, they
will all go scot free? You are easy now, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
think. You mistake. The hour of retribution is
near; it will come&mdash;it will come&mdash;”</p>

<p>She advanced on me so menacingly, that I
retreated to the open window. We were on the
second storey, and the window looked out on the
garden. I was very glad that at this minute the
garden was quite deserted. The noise could
have attracted eaves-droppers, who might have
insulted the stranger, whose visit I could in no
way understand, and who, as it seemed to me,
was quite incapable of being convinced.</p>

<p>“<em>You’re</em> innocent?” she asked. “<em>Innocent?</em>”</p>

<p>“Yes. I acted honestly. You will see. I’ll
show you; I’ll prove it to you.…”</p>

<p>“Answer me.&mdash;You advised the Princess to
come here.&mdash;You persuaded her!”</p>

<p>“I persuaded her.”</p>

<p>“You convinced her of the possibility of a
marriage with Orloff. No prevarication. You
hear; give me a straight answer,” repeated this
woman, trembling with emotion.</p>

<p>“The count himself assured me, on his word
of honour, that he meant marriage.”</p>

<p>“Perfidious betrayer! Death to you!” cried
the stranger, throwing her hands wildly about.</p>

<p>I had no time to step back. A bullet whizzed
by me. I was blinded by the smoke. I caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the mad woman by the wrist. She began struggling
with all her might, her face distorted with
passion, and once more fired at me, luckily with
no more success than at the first time. Wresting
the pistol from her hands, I threw it in the
garden. The noise had attracted the servants.
I heard knocks at the door. I flew to open it,
and trying to appear as calm as possible, I
assured them that having unloaded my pistol at
the window, it had gone off, but that nothing had
happened. They all left me and went away,
throwing side-glances at me. Having shut the
hall door, I returned to the stranger. I was in
a state of mind impossible to describe.</p>

<p>“Ah! ah! what have you done? How could
you? And for what? Why?”</p>

<p>My visitor put her head on the table and sobbed
wildly.</p>

<p>I began to pace the room up and down, and,
happening to glance at the mirror, I saw a face
which I could with difficulty recognise as my own.</p>

<p>“Look here,” at last said I to my visitor, “dry
your tears. You must know that I myself was
the victim of the most abominable deceit.” I
began relating to her everything that had passed.
“You see,” said I, finishing, “God is merciful,
and I am still alive. Now in your turn; explain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>The stranger could not for a long time utter
one word. Having given her some water, I invited
her to follow me into the garden. Here,
finally, she recovered her power of speech. Two
or three times she looked at me humbly, as
though asking for pardon, then at length she
began.</p>

<p>“My tale is sadder than yours is,” she said,
sobbing, after we had taken a few turns in the
garden, and had sat down; “but I have been so
guilty towards you,” covering her face with her
hands, “that you will never forgive me.”</p>

<p>“Forget all about that,” said I, recovering my
composure. “I am ready to forgive everything.…
All comes from God.… Everything
is in His hands.…”</p>

<p>The stranger turned towards me her pale,
sorrowful countenance, and taking me by the
hand again began sobbing.</p>

<p>“You are so generous,” she whispered. “Did
you ever hear of the fate of Merovitch?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! of course!”</p>

<p>“Well! I am&mdash;the guilty cause of his tentative.…
I was his affianced bride, Polixena
Pchelkina.”</p>

<p>I was speechless.… All the details of the
attempt of Merovitch, which I had heard ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
years ago from my old grandmother, memory
brought back vividly.</p>

<p>Bending towards her, I took her hand, the
one that had just fired at me, and pressed it with
emotion.</p>

<p>“Speak! speak!” whispered I.</p>

<p>“I could no longer remain in Russia,” she
continued in a strange hurried voice. “For ten
years I’ve wandered in all directions. I lived
in the nunneries of Volhynie and Lithuania. I
tended the sick and afflicted. A year ago, residing
on the borders of the Volga, I first heard
about the Princess Tarakanova, Dame D’Azow,
and Wladimirskaya. Persons, quite unknown to
me, called me to her side. You can understand
how I longed to be near her. I tried to get an
interview with her. Furnished with means by
those same unknown persons, I first made the
acquaintance of the Princess by letter, and then
personally at Ragusa. I instinctively believed
her. Oh! I did wish her happiness. Retribution
for the past! I took care of her, taught
her her native language and history, counselled
her, informed her on all points. I followed her
everywhere. After her departure from Ragusa
to Rome, I wrote to her, exhorted her to take
care. I was so convinced of her high destiny.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
You know the rest.… What was my horror
when I heard she was arrested! But I shall
remain at Livorno. I shall wait.… Oh! the
Livornians will set her free! But tell me, what
do you think of her? Are you also convinced
she is no Pretender, but really the daughter of
the Empress Elizabeth?”</p>

<p>“I can neither affirm nor deny.”</p>

<p>“But I am convinced. That idea is entwined
round my heart, and I cannot abandon it.”</p>

<p>My visitor rose. Having thrown her veil over
her head, she fixed her eyes upon me, pressed
my hand, and, looking as though she wished to
say something more, with faltering steps she took
her leave.</p>

<p>“You are good; you are compassionate,” said
she, turning round on reaching the garden gate.
“Till better times!”</p>

<p>I saw this mysterious person once or twice.
I went to her by invitation. She was living in
a small <i lang="it">asteria</i>, at the sign of “The Lily,”
within the walls of the convent of the Ursulines,
whither she had taken refuge. She still
hoped that the Princess might be saved, in
England or in Holland, which our squadron had
to pass.</p>

<p>“She&mdash;the persecuted&mdash;she is sent from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Heaven to resuscitate her birthland,” constantly
repeated Polixena, at our last meeting. “I
believe in her. She will not be lost. She will be
saved!”</p>

<p class="tb">In the night of the 26th of February, our
fleet, under the flag of the Vice-Admiral Greig,
was suddenly ordered to raise anchors and sail
for the West. Christianok, with the report of
the count to the empress, travelled by land.
He was ordered to go on to Moscow, where, after
the execution of Pougachoff, the empress had
taken up her residence. Count Alexis Gregorevitch
at the same time left Livorno. His residence
there was attended with too much risk.
Indignant at his dastardly act, the sons of the
ardent and free Italy became at last so enraged
against him, that the count, notwithstanding his
strong escort, dared not leave the house, and,
fearing poison, partook of only bread and milk.</p>

<p>I started later on. As if at the dictates of a
fatal destiny, I was ordered on board the newly
manned frigate, <i>The Northern Eagle</i>. This frigate
took not only the sick men of the crew, but also
the great collection which the count had been
at so much pains to acquire, consisting of pictures,
statues, bronzes, and other rare things. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
were the fruit of the count’s victories in the
Turkish and Grecian waters. Amongst other
things I found several presents made by the
Princess to the count, and, to my astonishment,
her portrait, resembling so much Elizabeth.
“But God’s ways are not our ways.” Hardly
had we loaded the frigate with the riches of
Orloff, and left the harbour, when we encountered
a most awful storm. I could not say to
the frigate, “You carry Cæsar!” Long were
we tossed on the waves, thrown first on the coast
of Algiers, then on that of Spain. Near Gibraltar
our two masts and all our sails were wrenched
away. Finally, we lost our rudder. For more
than a week the current and a light breeze have
borne us along the African coast. We have all
lost courage, and can but pray. On the tenth
day, that is to say, yesterday, the wind quite
fell. I go on writing&mdash;but can we expect to
be saved in this condition? The frigate, like a
lifeless corpse, maimed and disfigured in battle,
is borne whither the waves drive her&mdash;</p>

<p class="tb">Again another hopeless day has passed. The
dark terrifying night is coming on. Clouds are
gathering; again the wind is rising; now it is
raining. The coast of Africa has disappeared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and we are carried on to the West. The waves
are lashing against the sides of the ships, splashing
the deserted deck. The leak in the hold is
getting larger every minute. The exhausted
sailors can hardly pump any longer. The cannon
have been thrown overboard. At night we fire
our muskets, vainly imploring aid, but there’s
not a sail to be seen. We, doomed to perdition,
are alone. No one hears us. Tragic, awful fate.
To be lost on a solitary ship, without hope, and
with all the spoils of the commander-in-chief.
When will the end come? On which rock is our
ship destined to be wrecked, on which fated to
founder? Fit retribution for the action of others.
The fatal cargo of Count Orloff is hateful to God.</p>

<p class="tb">Three o’clock in the night. My confession is
ended. The bottle is ready; and if there’s no
hope of being saved, I’ll throw it in the sea.</p>

<p>One word more. I should like to let Irena&mdash;&mdash;my
last greeting; my last wish.&mdash;She ought to
know&mdash;Good God! what is that? Impossible!
Already the end? What an awful crash!&mdash;The
frigate has struck something. Ah! screams.&mdash;I
must run to my crew.&mdash;His Holy Will be done.</p>

<p class="tb">The bottle was thrown overboard, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
diary and a note. The last was written in
French: “Whoever finds this diary is requested
to forward it to Livorno, to the Russian lady,
Mistress Pchelkina. Should she not be found,
to Russia, Chernigoff, Brigadier Leon Rakitin,
for his daughter, Irena Rakitin. May 15th, 1775.
Pavel Konsov, lieutenant of the Russian fleet.”</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>EKATERINA AT MOSCOW.</i></span></h3>

<p>The Empress Ekaterina spent the summer of
1775 in the <i lang="ru">alentours</i> of Moscow, honouring with
her presence the village of Kolomensk, and
then that of Chërnaya-griaz, which she had
bought from Prince Kantomir. It had been
named in honour of its new mistress Tzaritzin.
She, in buying it, intended it to take the place
of the Muscovite Tzarskoë-selo.</p>

<p>On the borders of a dark forest, in the midst
of fallen maples, a two-storied wooden palace had
been hastily erected, with a few outhouses, some
stables and a poultry yard.</p>

<p>From the windows of her new palace the empress
could admire the extensive and deep clear
lakelets shaded by wooded hills, the boundless
newly-mown plains, with, scattered here and
there, the white shirts of the mowers, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
blue and red <i lang="ru">sarafans</i> of the hay-makers. Beyond
these plains others could be seen, yet
untouched by the sickle, sparkling in all their
emerald beauty; and again, beyond these, the
newly-ploughed corn-fields, and behind these, as
far as the eye could reach, green plains and
wooded hills; all this coloured and warmed by a
lovely sun in a blue cloudless sky.</p>

<p>Life here was simple and free. Through the
constantly open windows the scent of the newly-mown
hay and of the forest depths penetrated
everywhere. Often would a blackbird fly in from
the river, and from the plains came the grasshoppers
and the moths. From the early morning
the whole Court would be scattered in the forest,
picking flowers, looking for mushrooms, fishing
or sailing on the lakes, riding and driving in the
neighbourhood. Ekaterina, for the time being
clothed in a simple white morning robe, and
wearing a cap over her simply twisted hair,
would be seated at her writing table, writing
out schemes and drafts of various ukases, or
letters to the Parisian philosopher and <i lang="fr">publiciste</i>
Baron Grimme. She complained to him that her
servants would not give her more than two quills
a day, as they knew very well that she could not
regard with indifference a piece of white paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and a well-trimmed quill, but must sit down and
indulge her mania for paper soiling.</p>

<p>At the very time when all the world were
tiring their brains over the politics of the Russian
empress, as to what she would undertake in
regard to Turkey, which she had desolated, or
were discussing the delayed news of that recently-stifled
insurrection on the Volga, the late execution
of Pougachoff, and of the mysterious Princess
Tarakanova arrested lately at Livorno,
Ekaterina was describing to the Baron Grimme
the lives of her pet dogs.</p>

<p>These dogs were called at Court “Sir Tom
Anderson, and his consort” (by second marriage)
“Mimi, Lady Anderson.” They were such tiny,
shaggy little things, with sharp, intelligent noses,
and comical wiry tails, just like brooms. These
dogs had nice little soft mattresses and wadded
silk counterpanes, stitched by the hands of the
Empress herself. Ekaterina wrote to Grimme,
how fond she and Sir Tom were of sitting at the
open window, and how Tom, with his fore-paws
on the window-sill, notwithstanding his contemplation
of nature, would bark and snarl at the
horses towing the barges up the river. “The
views around are lovely, though a trifle monotonous,
and Sir Tom is delighted with the woods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the hills, and with the lovely quiet gardens and
manors, half buried in bright green, beyond which,
in the far-off blue, you can just distinguish the
tops of the golden Muscovite churches. This
village wilderness and solitude just suit the hearts
of Sir Anderson and his consort. Forgetting the
noise of the city and its gaiety, they admire the
beauties around them, and it is only at a late
hour that they allow themselves to be persuaded
to seek their warm wadded coverlets. The mistress
of the house also likes these solitary Russian
hamlets, forests and plains. I love these
unploughed new places,” wrote Ekaterina to
Grimme, “and I must say that I feel from my
heart that I only fit in where all is untouched
and unspoilt.”</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>THE PRINCESS AT ST. PETERSBURG.</i></span></h3>

<p>The fresh and clear atmosphere of the Muscovite
environs began to be foggy. Clouds were
gathering, lightning darting, thunder rolling.
The Court also had its storms. Ekaterina had
no easy task in investigating the insurrection of
Pougachoff. He astonished every one by preserving
to the very last minute the firm conviction
that he would be pardoned, that they
would never execute him. “The wretch has not
much sense&mdash;he still hopes!” wrote the empress,
after reading the interrogation of the
Pretender. “Human nature is unfathomable.”</p>

<p>Pougachoff was executed in January.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>About the middle of May Ekaterina received
information that the squadron under the command
of Greig had anchored at Cronstadt. The
empress sent her whole correspondence with
Orloff about the Pretender to the governor-general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of Petersburg, Prince Galitzin, and gave
him the following order:&mdash;“Have the <i lang="fr">voyageurs</i>
transferred secretly from the ship, and submit
them to the severest interrogation.”</p>

<p>Prince Alexandre Michaelovitch Galitzin, defeated
by Frederick the Great, and afterwards
for his victories over the Turks elected to the
post of field-marshal, seemed a very imposing
personage; but in reality he was the best-hearted
and most modest and just of men, and an entire
stranger to all Court intrigues. He was loved
and respected by all.</p>

<p>On the 24th May the prince summoned an
officer of the Préobrajenski regiment, by name
Tolstoï, made him take an oath of secrecy, and
ordered him to start for Cronstadt to receive the
prisoner who would be given over to him, and
carefully hand her over to the commandant of
the Petropavlovski fortress, André Gavrilovitch
Tchernishoff.</p>

<p>Tolstoï fulfilled his mission on the night of the
25th of May. In a specially manned yacht, he
sailed down the Neva very gently to the fortress,
where he gave up his prisoner. At first she was
lodged hastily in a room just under the apartment
of the commandant. Afterwards she was transferred
to the Ravelin Alexéef. Oushakoff, secretary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
to the Prince Galitzin, had already prepared
a report about her from the papers sent by the
empress. Oushakoff was brisk, paunchy, stout,
and always panting and repeating with a knavish
smile in his eyes&mdash;“Oh! my dear fellow, so much
to do, so much to do! I only serve the prince
for the honour of it, but I ought long ago to have
taken my <i lang="de">abshiede</i>,<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> I am literally worn out.”</p>

<p>The Prince Galitzin pondered long over the
report of Oushakoff, drew up a whole list of
questions, and with a very important mien, which
did not in the least become his good-natured face,
entered the prison of the captive. He was very
much put out by the news which he had just
heard, that on the journey, not far from England,
the captive had nearly escaped; that at Plymouth
she had all at once thrown herself overboard into
a small vessel, which was in readiness for her (as
was easily to be seen), and that it was with great
difficulty and disregard for her cries and groans
that they had managed to get her on board
again. The prince was afraid that some one
might attempt to effect her escape here. The
captive, terrified, confused by all that had happened,
by her gloomy and dismal prison, did not
deny that she was called and was looked upon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
a Russian grand-duchess. She even went so far
as to declare that, recollecting her childhood,
she, on the strength of circumstances, believed
herself to be the grand-duchess of whom mention
was made in the will of the Emperor Peter I.,
which, she said, she had found among her
papers, and which was all in favour of the late
Empress Elizabeth, and by the will of Elizabeth
made in favour of her daughter. A copy of this
interrogation was sent to Moscow to the Empress
Ekaterina, who was very indignant at the impudence
of the captive, and especially when she
found a letter addressed to herself, signed “Elizabeth.”
“Well, that woman is a <i lang="fr">fieffée canaille</i>,”<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
exclaimed Ekaterina, crumpling the letter in her
hands, after having read it. Potemkin was at
that time sitting in the study of the empress.
“Of whom are you speaking?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh! always about the same vagrant, Batiushka;
about that Italian vagabond.”</p>

<p>Potemkin,&mdash;who really pitied Tarakanova, for
two reasons: first, because she was a woman;
and then, because she was the prey of Orloff, to
him hateful,&mdash;began to speak in her favour. The
empress, without a word, handed him a whole
parcel of German and French newspapers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
then told him that he would do better to look and
see for himself all the calumnies spread about her
and this Pretender; whereupon he, snuffling and
grumbling, began to scan the papers with his
short-sighted eyes.</p>

<p>“Well!” asked Ekaterina, looking up from
some papers she had been glancing at.</p>

<p>“Incredible.&mdash;So much slander! It’s difficult
to give an opinion.”</p>

<p>“To me, it’s all clear,” said Ekaterina. “Just
a second edition of the Marquis Pougachoff; and
you must agree, prince, with me, that it is impossible
to have any pity for this ‘victim,’ if
you like, ‘of foreign intrigues.’”</p>

<p>Galitzin received another order. He was to
put down the impudence of the adventuress,
especially, as in the words of the English ambassador,
“she was no princess, but the daughter
of an innkeeper of Prague.”</p>

<p>The information of the ambassador regarding
her was told to the Princess, at which she was
very indignant.</p>

<p>“If I only knew who slandered me thus,” she
exclaimed furiously, “I would scratch his eyes
out.”</p>

<p>“Good God! what can all this mean?” she
would cry out, horrified at her position. “I so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
ardently, so blindly believed in myself, in my
mission. Can it be that they are right? Is it
possible that under the load of these horrible
proofs which are constantly cropping up, I shall
have to bid adieu to all my convictions, to all my
hopes? Never, that shall never be. I will rise
above all; I will never give in!” That her pride
might be taken down, the captive was treated
much more severely. She was deprived for some
time of the services of her maid, and of many
other little comforts. Her food was much more
simple, almost coarse; but all in vain. Neither
prayers, nor threats to take away from her her
own garments and furnish her with prison
clothes could awaken any repentance in her, or
extort from her the confession that she was an
impostor and not a princess.</p>

<p>“I am not a pretender, do you hear?” she
would scream in furious indignation to Galitzin.
“You are a prince; I only a feeble woman.…
In the name of the All-Merciful God, do
not torment me; have pity upon me.”</p>

<p>The prince, forgetting his orders, would begin
consoling her.</p>

<p>“I am pregnant,” inadvertently said the captive,
crying. “I shall perish, but not alone.…
Send me where you like&mdash;to the Eskimos, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
snows of Siberia, to a convent.… No,
on my word of honour, I’m innocent.…”</p>

<p>Galitzin became thoughtful.</p>

<p>“Who is the father of your unborn child?” he
asked at last.</p>

<p>“Count Alexis Orloff.”</p>

<p>“Again a lie,” said Galitzin. “And why,
what for? Are you not ashamed to answer like
that? To a man whom the empress trusts so
highly, to an old man?”</p>

<p>“It is only the truth. Before God!” answered
the captive, sobbing. “The admiral, the officers,
the whole fleet can bear witness to it.…”</p>

<p>The bewildered Galitzin put a stop to his
interrogation, and sent a report of the new confession
to the empress at Moscow.</p>

<p class="tb">“Miserable, impudent wretch!” screamed out
Ekaterina, after reading this report to Potemkin.
“See how this new edition of Pougachoff, sent
to us by the Poles&mdash;how she knows how to
slander and calumniate others!”</p>

<p>“Well; but if there should be some truth in
it,” slowly said Potemkin. “It’s so easy to
betray a poor, weak, confiding woman.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s impossible!” answered Ekaterina.
“At any rate, Orloff will soon be here. He’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
soon tell us all about this false Elizabeth.…
And you, prince, in your knightly defence of a
woman, do not forget the most important thing&mdash;the
peace of the kingdom. We went through
enough in the last insurrection.”</p>

<p>Potemkin was silent.</p>

<p>From day to day Orloff was expected. He
was hastening from Italy to be present at the
celebration of the peace with Turkey. At this
time Galitzin had received other orders,&mdash;to deprive
the captive of everything except what was
strictly necessary, to make her put on prison
clothes, and having sent her maid away, to put
two sentinels as a constant watch over her.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>THE HISTORIOGRAPHER, MILLER.</i></span></h3>

<p>The obstinacy of the captive astonished and
angered Ekaterina very much.</p>

<p>“How is this?” she reasoned. “I have conquered
Turkey; Pougachoff has been caught,
has acknowledged his imposture, and been
publicly executed; … and that miserable,
puny woman, that adventuress, … will not
acknowledge anything, and dares to threaten me,
from her cellar … from her den.”</p>

<p>Potemkin, after having heard from Christianok
all the details of the arrest of the Princess, was
very morose and silent. Ekaterina ascribed it
to his frequent fits of melancholy.</p>

<p>Soon it became known to many of those about
the empress, what means Orloff had employed
to entice and then betray the unfortunate captive,
and these were soon communicated to the
empress through the medium of her maid
Perekousikhin. At first Ekaterina would not
believe any of these rumours, and severely reprimanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
her maid on this account. The
secret report of the honest and incorruptible
Galitzin concerning the position and condition
of the captive, all the courtiers had made known
to the empress. The womanly heart of Ekaterina
was moved with indignation. “Not Radzivill,”
she said; “he, threatened with confiscation of his
enormous estates, did not betray the devoted
woman!”</p>

<p>“Betrayer by nature!” shot through the brain
of Ekaterina, when she recollected the services of
Orloff; … “ready for anything, unscrupulous
in all; stopping at nothing in his own interests,”
and then Ekaterina remembered the phrase,
“Matoushka Tzaritza, pardon. You didn’t think,
you did not guess&mdash;”<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>“Not for nothing do they call him butcher,”
contemptuously murmured Ekaterina. “Oh!
he’ll just say that, out of devotion, he ‘oversalted
it.’ … Well! he’ll soon be here. He must
be made to mend that affair. That fallen one,
without family, nameless, tribeless; a toy in
the hands of the wicked, in his arms she’ll be
powerless.… And she, after selling beer
at Prague, well! how dares she disdain Russian
dignitary or count? Where’s&mdash;the <i lang="fr">mésalliance</i>?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The calm village scenes of Tzaritzin and Kolomenski,
began to weary Ekaterina. The forests,
the lakelets, the birds and the butterflies no
longer brought her peaceful dreams.</p>

<p>The empress suddenly started for Moscow
alone.</p>

<p>There, in the Chinese city, or Kitaï-Gorod, she
visited the archives of the Minister of the Interior,
where several important papers had been sent
for revision. The director of the archives was
the celebrated author of the “History of Russia”
and of “The Description of the Empire of
Siberia;” late editor of the academical journal,
“Monthly Compositions;” traveller and Russian
historiographer;&mdash;the academician Miller. He
was then already seventy. The empress herself
was very fond of history, and knew him very
well, having often had very long conversations
with him about his works, and in general about
history. She found him in his room, near the
archives, busily turning over a heap of old
Muscovite manuscripts.</p>

<p>Miller was very fond of flowers and birds. The
rooms of his governmental department, not very
lofty, were hung all around with cages of blackbirds,
bullfinches, and others of the feathered
tribe, which quite deafened Ekaterina with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
loud whistling and twittering. A glass door
opened from the study of the master of the house
into another room, ornamented with large plants
set in green tubs. The windows were open, but
a net which covered them prevented the birds,
which were flying about, from taking their departure.
The neat and pretty, although simple,
room was filled with the perfume of roses and
heliotropes. The greatest cleanliness reigned
everywhere. The floors were as polished as a
mirror. Miller was writing at his table near the
glass door leading to his aviary. The empress,
passing by, motioned the officious servant away,
and came up to him unnoticed.</p>

<p>“I have come to you, Gerard Feodorovitch,
with a request,” said Ekaterina, on entering the
room.</p>

<p>Miller jumped up, apologising for his morning
costume.</p>

<p>“Command me, your Majesty,” said he, hastily
arranging his dress, and searching with his eyes
for his spectacles, which he missed.</p>

<p>The empress took a seat, invited him to do
the same, and the conversation began.</p>

<p>“Is it true,” she began, after having made
several gracious inquiries after his health, and
that of his large family, “is it true?&mdash;it is said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
that you have collected evidence, that you are
convinced that it was not a usurper, a pretender
who ascended the throne of Moscow;
that Grishka Otropieff was the real Tzarevitch
Dimitri? You said something about it&mdash;to the
English traveller, Cox.”</p>

<p>The good-natured, absent-minded Miller, always
lost in his researches, was very much puzzled
at this question of the empress.</p>

<p>“Where on earth could she have heard that?”
thought he. “Could Cox have blundered it
out?”</p>

<p>“Let us be candid; I’ll help you,” continued
Ekaterina. “You possess a wonderful memory,
and withal you are so very perspicacious in deciphering
and comparing manuscripts. Give me
openly and boldly your opinion. We are alone;
no one can hear us. Is it true that the evidence
for the condemnation of the Pretender was weak,
almost nothing?”</p>

<p>Miller became thoughtful. His grey hair was
ruffled, and his good-natured, intelligent mouth,
which just before the entrance of the empress
had held a half-finished cigar in an amber
mouth-piece, was now unconsciously nervously
twitching.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is true,” he answered, hesitating;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
“but, excuse me, that is quite my own personal
opinion, nothing more.”</p>

<p>“But if so, then why do you not publish such
a very important judgment?”</p>

<p>“But, your Majesty,” stammered Miller, looking
about him with a bewildered gaze, pulling at
his waistcoat, “I read the account of the researches
made by Vassili Shouiski at Ouglitch.
He made those researches by order of Godounoff.
It was to his interest to please Boris, and he did
this by bringing to him the evidence only of
those who affirmed that the Tzarevitch had really
been killed. Of course, any one can see that all
other evidence which might have been disagreeable
to Godounoff he would suppress.”</p>

<p>“Which other?” asked Ekaterina.</p>

<p>“That another one was killed, and that the
former was hidden; but of course, you know
yourself, that this very same Shouiski publicly
acknowledged the resuscitated Dimitri.”</p>

<p>“A very witty proof,” said Ekaterina. “Not
for nothing does General Potemkin, great amateur
historian, advise me to have all that
published, if you are really convinced of its
truth?”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, your Majesty,” stammered
Miller; “the will of the empress&mdash;is an important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
guide; but there’s another, a power still
higher&mdash;Russia. I am a Lutheran; the body of
the recognised Dimitri lies in the cathedral of
the Kremlin. What would become of all my
researches, what would become of my own
person, amidst your own nation, if I dared to
assert that not Grishka Otropieff had ascended
the Muscovite throne, but the real Tzarevitch
Dimitri?”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>MILLER’S REPLY.</i></span></h3>

<p>The words of Miller disturbed Ekaterina very
much.</p>

<p>“Well, candid at any rate,” thought she;
“just like a philosopher.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the empress; “let the dead
rest in peace; we will talk about the living. I
think General Potemkin has sent you the examination,
and the evidence taken in respect of that
impudent Pretender, the arrest of whom you
have heard about, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he sent them,” answered Miller, remembering
at last that the spectacles for which
he had been constantly searching with his eyes
were on his forehead, and wondering how he
could have forgotten that.</p>

<p>“Well, and what have you to say of that
worthy sister of the Marquis Pougachoff?”
asked Ekaterina.</p>

<p>Miller at that very moment caught sight,
through the glass door, of one of his canaries,
a very quarrelsome bird, who had just flown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
into another’s nest, the mistress of which was
twittering, flying round, and trying to turn her
out. His eyes also wandered to a sick blackbird
with its leg bound up.</p>

<p>Miller, recollecting himself, and colouring at his
own timidity and absent-mindedness, answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Princess, if she is Russian, learnt Russian
history very insufficiently; that’s the main
thing I have to say, after reading her papers;
but of course, that would be more her teacher’s
fault.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think? Can it be that
there is a spark of truth in her tale?” asked
Ekaterina. “Do you suppose for one moment
that the Empress Elizabeth might have had
such a daughter, and hidden her from all eyes?”</p>

<p>Miller was just on the point of answering:
“Oh! yes, of course; what is there in all that
so very improbable?” but he remembered at
that minute about the mysterious youth, Alexis
Shkourin, travelling now in foreign parts, and in
his confusion fixed his eyes on the glass door of
his aviary.</p>

<p>“Well, and why do you not answer?” said
Ekaterina, smiling. “Your Lutheranism does
not stand in the way here.”</p>

<p>“Well, everything is possible, your Majesty,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
said Miller, shaking his grey curly head. “People
do say all sorts of things; some of them may
be true.”</p>

<p>“Look here&mdash;would it not be strange?” said
Ekaterina. “The late Razoumovski was a very
good man, and although secretly, still he was
the lawful, husband of Elizabeth. Why trample
under foot all the laws of nature? Why this
heartless denial of their own daughter?”</p>

<p>“Then it was one century, now it’s another,”
answered Miller. “Morals differ; if the new
Shouiski-Shouvalovi could hide for so many years
in solitary confinement the, to them, dangerous
Prince John, proclaimed in his infancy emperor,
what is there here so very strange, if, in their
thirst after influence and power, they should
have sent to the end of the earth, or, at any rate,
hidden another infant, this unfortunate Princess?”</p>

<p>“But, Gerard Feodorovitch, you forget the
most important thing&mdash;the mother! How could
the empress have borne that? You cannot deny
her heart was in the right place; and then, all
this was not about a strange child, like Ivanushka,
but about her own forsaken daughter.”</p>

<p>“Well! oh, it is very simple,” answered
Miller. “Razoumovski, I should think, had
nothing at all to do with it. The whole intrigue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
was brought to bear on the empress&mdash;not on the
mother.… Very likely, many reasons were
brought forward, and she consented. This secret
daughter was hidden, sent to the South, and then
over the Urals. In the papers of the Princess
she speaks of poison, of flight from Siberia
to Persia, afterwards to Germany, and then
to France.… The Shouiskis of our days
have repeated the old tragedy. In guarding
the empress, they still kept in readiness for
any emergency, a new refugee, saved by them
from another world.”</p>

<p>Ekaterina here remembered that Orloff, in one
of his letters, had spoken of a Russian traveller,
Ivan Shouvaloff, who was even now in foreign
parts.</p>

<p>“With you, one might go on talking for ever,”
said Ekaterina, rising. “Your memory in itself
is a whole archive, and a priceless one, too; and
Russian history, is it not true? like Russia
itself, is richest virgin-soil. How lovely our
boundless corn-fields! But then, again, the
weeds. Ah, <i lang="fr">àpropos</i>! I do always admire your
flowers and your birds. Now, do pay me a visit
at Tzaritzin. Grimme has sent me a whole
family of the loveliest cockatoos. One of them
is always repeating ‘<i lang="fr">où est la vérité?</i>’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Having with special graciousness thanked
Miller for his information, the empress returned
to the palace. Soon after this event, the hero of
Chesma, Orloff, made his appearance.</p>

<p>Alexis Gregorevitch failed to recognise the
court. With new faces, a new order of things
had been introduced. The count did not at
once receive the honour of an interview with the
empress. He was told she was not quite well.
This made him feel very anxious. Well versed
in court life, he scented disfavour in the air. It
became urgent to take measures. Very diffidently,
Alexis Gregorevitch turned to some of
the courtiers to try and get an audience with the
new sun, Potemkin. The interview took place
with great politeness on both sides, but no
geniality. Their old friendship and fraternity
had been left far behind. They conversed till
midnight, but the guest felt he had learnt very
little.</p>

<p>“Yes, now it’s all without measure, all overflowing,”
said Potemkin <i lang="fr">en passant</i>, speaking
about something. Orloff long pondered over
those words. “Overflowing!”&mdash;well, had not he
also filled the measure too full?</p>

<p>In the morning he was invited to go to the
empress, whom he found bathing her dogs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
“Sir Tom Anderson,” who had already been
taken out of the bath and wiped dry, was warming
himself under his coverlet. His consort,
“Mimi,” was still in the water. Ekaterina sat
near, holding ready the warm coverlet. Perekousikhin,
in a large apron, her sleeves rolled up to
the elbows, was very energetically rubbing the
little dog with a sponge and soap. Quite wet,
and white from the soap, Mimi, on seeing the
big goggle-eyed stranger, began barking most
furiously and straining to get at him.</p>

<p>“Ah! from water to water,” said Ekaterina
jokingly. “Welcome back to your native land.
We shall soon be ready.”</p>

<p>Having wrapped Mimi up warmly and put her
in the basket, the empress dried her hands, and
remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p>“As you see, friends first of all!” She took
a seat, pointed out a chair to Orloff, and began
questioning him about his journeys, about Italy,
and the Turkish affairs.</p>

<p>“But, oh! Batiushka Alexis Gregorevitch,
you oversalted, oversalted it,” said the empress,
producing her snuff-box, and slowly taking a
pinch.</p>

<p>“In what, your Majesty?”</p>

<p>“In that certain little affair,” smilingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
answered Ekaterina, menacing him with her
finger.</p>

<p>Orloff noticed the smile, but at the same time,
in that very same joke, he noticed a well-known&mdash;to
him&mdash;bad sign. The round, strong chin of
Ekaterina trembled slightly.</p>

<p>“In what? Matoushka Tzaritza, and in what
is my crime?” he asked, stammering.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Comment donc, Monsieur?</i> Yes, really oversalted
it,” continued Ekaterina, slowly taking
another pinch from her snuff-box.</p>

<p>At this, Orloff, like a child, lost all self-possession;
his eyes wandered timorously round
the room.</p>

<p>“You know; our captive,” said the empress,&mdash;“Oh,
I suppose you’ve heard it; she’ll soon be
two.…”</p>

<p>The athlete Orloff knew not what to do in his
confusion.</p>

<p>“I am lost, completely lost!” thought he;
and his disgrace, his downfall arose before his
eyes. “Mercy, oh God!”</p>

<p>“But that we may arrange, matters may be
mended,” continued Ekaterina. “You might go
to Petersburg, see the captive. To celebrate the
peace, you have returned to her as her bridegroom.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Orloff knit his brows, bent one knee to the
ground, kissed the hand that was held out to him,
and silently left the room. At the door, he regained
his self-composure.</p>

<p>“Well! what! the empress! What did she
say?” asked the courtiers.</p>

<p>“I have been honoured with a special invitation
to the fêtes,” answered the count, “and now
I am going to Petersburg to arrange my brother’s
affairs.”</p>

<p>Count Orloff tried to seem very elated, very
proud.… He understood that it was better
for him to make haste. It was clear that the
empress was not joking. Under pretence of an
interview with his brother, he hastened the preparations
for his journey, and was soon on his
way to Petersburg.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>ORLOFF AND THE PRINCESS.</i></span></h3>

<p>Worn out with her long sea voyage and imprisonment,
the captive dragged on a miserable existence
in the fortress. An acute fever, a sharp
cough, accompanied by frequent hemorrhage, had
developed into rapid consumption.</p>

<p>The frequent visits and questions of the field-marshal
Galitzin always threw the Princess into
fits of passion.</p>

<p>“What right have you to treat me like this?”
she would say in an imperative voice. “What
reason have I given for such treatment?”</p>

<p>“Written orders from a higher power&mdash;the
will of the empress!” answered, panting and
puffing, the secretary, Oushakoff.</p>

<p>In the capacity of secretary to the Commission
which had been appointed, he had large means
placed at his disposal. Therefore, continually
complaining of fatigue, of a mass of occupations,
and even of pains in his spine, he lingered over
the evidence, brought forward a multitude of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
facts, began a long correspondence about her
affairs, and in general led the good-natured
Galitzin by the nose, and on the savings made
from the money allotted for the keep of the
captive managed to buy a nice little house in the
courtyard already belonging to him in the Gorokhoviya.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>In the interval, the false testament found
among the papers of Tarakanova was shown to
her.</p>

<p>“Well, what have you to say to that?” asked
Galitzin.</p>

<p>“I swear by the Almighty God, by eternal
damnation, that I am the author of none of those
unfortunate papers. I was told all that.”</p>

<p>“But they are in your own handwriting.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps&mdash;it interested me.”</p>

<p>“Then you do not wish to confess to anything,
or explain the truth?”</p>

<p>“I’ve nothing to confess. I lived in freedom,
I did harm to no one. I was betrayed, made
prisoner by treason.”</p>

<p>Galitzin began to lose patience. “What a
she-devil they’ve handed over to me!” thought
he. “Extract a secret from a stone like that!”
The prince groaned aloud and rubbed his nose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“But, your Grace, recollect,” once whispered
the officious Oushakoff, “your hands are unfettered.
In the last ukase it makes mention
of the utmost severity, of investigation without
partiality.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course, one might try,” muttered
the bewildered prince, who was in general averse
to any severe measure. “Shall I try? It won’t
be worse than it is.”</p>

<p>“In the name of the empress,” severely said
the field-marshal to the commandant, in the
presence of the captive, “in view of her obstinacy&mdash;deprive
her of everything, except the strictly
necessary clothing and bedding. You hear, everything&mdash;books,
and other things, there; and then,
if that does not answer, put her on common
prison food.”</p>

<p>The orders of the prince were carried out.
The poor, ailing girl, brought up in luxury and
comfort, began to receive nothing but black
bread, soldier’s <i lang="ru">kasha</i> (porridge), and <i lang="ru">schi</i> (sour
cabbage soup). Although hungry, she would sit
for hours shedding bitter tears over the wooden
bowl, but not touching it. On the way to Russia,
near the shores of Holland, where the squadron
had anchored to take in provisions, she had read
in a newspaper, which had fallen by accident into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
her cabin, all the past life of Orloff, and trembling
with passion, she had cursed her folly in having
believed in such a man. But worse misery
awaited her. Two soldiers were assigned to the
captive, and kept watch in her room, night and
day. All this would throw the prisoner into fits
of passion.</p>

<p>“Repent,” Galitzin would say to her. “I pity
you from my heart, but without repentance,
don’t expect forgiveness.”</p>

<p>“I’ll accept every torment, even death, Sir
Marshal; I’ll accept everything,” said the captive.
“But you are mistaken.… Nothing
can make me withdraw my evidence.”</p>

<p>“Think over it.…”</p>

<p>“God is my witness.… My torments will
fall on the heads of my tormentors.”</p>

<p>“She’ll think over it, your Grace!” whispered
Oushakoff, turning over some papers. “One
more experiment. She’ll come round all right.”</p>

<p>The experiment was tried. Her Venetian silk
nightdress was exchanged for one of sackcloth.</p>

<p>“Almighty God! be witness of my most secret
thoughts,” prayed the captive. “What am I to
do, what shall I undertake? I believed in my
past. It all seemed so plain. I was accustomed
to think of it all, to live in that idea. Neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the treason of that monster, nor my captivity,
has been able to shake my conviction. No, and
not even this iron dungeon, which seems to crush
me, can do that. Death is not far off. Oh!
Mother of God, oh! lowly Jesus, help me. Who
will give me strength, who will guide me, who
will save me&mdash;from all these horrors, from this
prison?”</p>

<p class="tb">One cold rainy evening, a hired carriage with
the blinds drawn down drove up to the <i lang="fr">perron</i> of
the commandant of the fortress of Petropavlovski,
André Gavrilovitch Tchernishoff. Half an hour
afterwards, Orloff and the commandant walked
in the direction of the Ravelin Alexéef.</p>

<p>“Failing,” said the commandant, walking on,
“failing rapidly, especially with this dampness.
Yesterday, your Grace, she begged for her own
clothes and books; they were returned to her.”</p>

<p>The sentinels were called out of the room of
the Princess. Orloff entered the room alone.
Tchernishoff remained outside the door. In the
dusk, the count could hardly see the low-ceilinged
room, with two deeply set windows with thick
iron gratings. Between the two windows stood
a small table with two chairs. A few books were
scattered on the table together with some other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
things, and, covered with a coarse cloth, stood the
untouched food. On the right-hand side stood a
screen. Behind the screen was a small table
with a water-bottle, a glass, and a cup, and surrounded
by chintz curtains, a small iron bedstead.
On the bed, in a white dressing gown and cap,
lay a girl, so pale, one might think she was dead,
covered with a blue velvet mantilla.</p>

<p>Orloff was struck by the frail look of her, who
such a short time ago had been so stately, and so
charmingly beautiful. There flashed across his
mind remembrances of Italy, tender letters, the
ardent courtship, the journey to Livorno, the feast
on the ship, Ribas and Christianok travestied in
the old clerical vestments. “Oh! why did I
play that comedy with the marriage ceremony?”
thought he. “She was really on board my ship,
in my hands.” And vividly there flashed through
his mind the picture of the arrest of the Princess.
He remembered her cries on deck, and the next
day his message to her through Konsov, a letter
in German, describing his own false sorrow, oaths
of faithfulness till death, and assurances of love.
“What sorrow has fallen upon us”&mdash;trying to
write the most tender words, he had said. “We

will not forsake us. Let us put our trust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
in Him. As soon as I get my liberty, I’ll search
the whole world till I find you, to guard and
serve you all my life.” “And I have found her;
here she is!” thought Orloff, involuntarily shuddering,
not daring to cross the threshold. At
last he ventured near her, close to the screen.
At the sound, the unfortunate girl opened her
eyes, looked at her visitor, and rose. Her auburn
hair, at one time so luxuriant, fell from under her
cap, and half-covered her poor pale face, distorted
by illness and passion.</p>

<p>“You? You&mdash;in this room&mdash;near me!”
screamed out the Princess, recognising her
visitor, and stretching out both her hands in
front of her, as though driving away some awful
apparition.</p>

<p>Orloff stood motionless.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>ORLOFF’S INTERVIEW WITH THE PRINCESS.</i></span></h3>

<p>The words seemed to burst from her throat, and
die upon her lips. She threw herself back on
the bed to the farthest side of the wall, where
with flaming eyes she looked ready to devour
Orloff, who stood gazing at her horror-stricken.</p>

<p>“Yes! we are married, are we not? Ha, ha,
ha! we are man and wife?” said she, but a convulsive
cough cut short her indignation for the
moment. “Where have you been all this time?
<em>You</em> promised, <em>I</em> waited.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” gently said Orloff, “let us forget
the past, let us play comedy no longer. You
must realize by this time that I was the faithful
slave of my sovereign, and that I only obeyed
her commands.”</p>

<p>“Treachery, deceit!” screamed the unhappy
girl; “never will I believe it.… Do you hear
me? The great and powerful Russian empress
would never have had recourse to such perfidy.”</p>

<p>“I swear to you they were her orders.…”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I do not believe one word of it, traitor,”
screamed the unfortunate girl, shaking her fists
at him. “Ekaterina could command anything&mdash;demand
my surrender, burn down the town that
gave me refuge, take me by force, but not that.
But <em>you</em>, you yourself, might have pierced me
with a dagger, poisoned me. You knew of
poisons,&mdash;but what have you done with me?
what?”</p>

<p>“One moment of calmness, I implore you,” at
last said Orloff. “Answer me one word, only one&mdash;and
I promise you, on my word of honour,
that you shall be set free immediately.</p>

<p>“What new invention is that, monster? Speak,
traitor,” said the Princess, recovering some composure,
as shudderingly she drew the blue mantilla,
so well known to the count, closer around
her.</p>

<p>“You have been questioned so long, and with
such persistency,” began Orloff, trying to give
his voice a tender and convincing tone, “tell me
now all&mdash;we are alone; God only can see and
hear us.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="it">Gran Dio!</i>” said the unfortunate girl, “he
invokes the name of God,” added she, raising her
eyes to the image of the Saviour which hung on
the wall over the head of her bed; “he! Very
likely you have arranged this slow torture, this
torment! and yet you boasted that torture was
abolished here. The empress, I am sure, knows
nothing of all this. In this matter she has been
deceived, as in everything else.”</p>

<p>“Be calm, be calm.… Tell me, who
are you?” continued Orloff; “hide nothing.
I’ll implore the empress; she will be merciful
to you and to me.…”</p>

<p>“<i lang="it">Diavolo!</i> he asks, ‘Who am I!’” she
stammered, half stifled by a new fit of anger.
“But cannot you see I have done with the world?
I am dying; then to what end all this?” She
again began to cough most awfully, and leaning
her head against the wall, was silent.</p>

<p>“There,&mdash;she’ll die without having confessed
anything,” thought Orloff, as he stood by her.</p>

<p>“In riches and in happiness,” said she, coming
to herself, “in humiliation and in prison, I repeat
constantly the same thing&mdash;and you know it
well. I am the daughter of your late empress,”
proudly said she, rising. “Do you hear me,
miserable, wretched slave, I am your born grand-duchess.…”
A bold idea flashed through
Orloff’s mind.… “Ah! what’s in a word?”
thought he; “she won’t live long, and at one
stroke I’ll please them both.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>He bent on one knee, grasped the frail pale
hand of the captive, and ardently pressed it to
his lips.</p>

<p>“Your Highness!” stammered he. “Elise!
pardon, I swear&mdash;yes, I am guilty,&mdash;but those
were the orders. I myself was arrested. Only
now have I received my liberty.…”</p>

<p>The poor girl raised her big, astonished eyes
to his face, covering her mouth with her handkerchief
to stop the blood.</p>

<p>“I implore you, I promise you, we will be
really solemnly married,” continued Orloff. “You
shall be my wife&mdash;and then, your Highness&mdash;my
darling, … my own Elise, rank, riches,
faithfulness, life-long devotion.…”</p>

<p>“Out! away! monster!” screamed the captive,
jumping up. “This bruised hand princes,
kings sought&mdash;it’s not for you to touch it,
branded traitor, inquisitor.”</p>

<p>“Well, she doesn’t choose her words,” thought
to himself the Commandant Tchernishoff, who,
standing outside the door, could easily hear the
French abuses and the curses of the prisoner;
“better take myself off. If the count knows all
this has been heard, his little vanity will be
pricked, and it is just possible he may take his
revenge.” The commandant walked off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>The jailer, standing in the long corridor, with
his keys, and also hearing the, to him, quite
unintelligible cries, the stamping of feet, and, as
it seemed to him, the noise of things being thrown
at the visitor, also walked off into a corner, thinking
to himself: “Ha, ha, Mamzoulka (Mademoiselle),
it seems, is asking for better food; it
seems it’s not in the articles. She’s screaming at
the general, oho! Of course it’s not for such as
she, so thin, to eat <i lang="ru">schi</i> and <i lang="ru">schi</i>. Yesterday, for
the first time, they gave her milk.” The furious
screams continued. Then came the sound of
broken glass. The door of the dungeon was flung
open rapidly, and Orloff, humbly bending under
the door, too low for his tall person, came out.
His face was purple; he lingered for a moment in
the corridor, and stared about him, as if collecting
his thoughts. Having felt under his arm for
his cocked hat, passed his fingers through his
hair, and pulled down his coat, he briskly and
smartly drew himself up, and silently walked out
in the pouring rain, jumped into the carriage,
and shouted to the coachman, “Général Procureur.”</p>

<p>As he left the fortress behind him, Orloff began
turning over in his mind the details of the
last interview.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, she <em>is</em> a serpent, a viper!” he whispered
to himself, looking out into the streets from the
carriage window; “didn’t she sting!”</p>

<p>Very reservedly, and with plenty of self-composure,
he entered the house of the Prince
Alexander Alexéeovitch Viazimski. It was already
late. The candles were lighted. Orloff
shivered, and rubbed his hands together.</p>

<p>“Take a seat,” said the général procureur.
“What! cold?”</p>

<p>“Yes, prince, a little.”</p>

<p>Viazimski ordered a servant to bring in liqueurs.
The servant soon came, bringing a lovely decanter,
and a silver basket containing ginger biscuits.</p>

<p>“Pray help yourself, count.… Well!
what about our usurper?” continued the général
procureur, putting aside some papers that he had
just been looking over.</p>

<p>“Impudent beyond all bounds; still persists.…”
answered Count Alexis, pouring himself
out a wineglassful of the rich liqueur, and raising
it first to his nose, and then to his lips.</p>

<p>“Well, of course!” said the prince; “she has
no wish to part with her so-called titles and
rights cheaply.”</p>

<p>“Oh! she’ll give plenty of trouble yet; other
measures than those are wanted,” said Orloff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“But what others, Batienka? Her last minutes
are drawing near.… You would not have
her strangled?”</p>

<p>“And why not?” whispered Orloff, as if to
himself, dipping a biscuit into a fresh glass of
liqueur. “Pity for such like!”</p>

<p>The général procureur threw a side-long glance
from behind the green <i lang="fr">abat-jour</i> on his visitor.
“And you’re not joking, Alexis Gregorevitch?
It’s your advice?”</p>

<p>“Oh! for the good of my country, and like a
true patriot&mdash;not only would I advise, but very
much recommend,” answered Orloff, walking
backwards and forwards, munching the sweet
melting biscuits.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Mais, c’est un assassin dans l’âme!</i>” thought
to himself the great judge,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> whose personal appearance
was austere and generally gloomy, as
he listened in horror to the soft, cat-like tread
of Orloff on the carpet; “<i lang="fr">c’est en lui comme une
mauvaise habitude</i>!”</p>

<p>Orloff took out his eye-glass, and, biting a fresh
biscuit, began to admire a picture of Psyche and
Cupid on the wall.</p>

<p>“Whence came this picture?” asked he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is a gift from the empress.… Count,
when do you think of returning to Moscow?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow morning. I shall not of course
delay my information, but shall instantly report
the fresh obstinacy of that impudent liar.”</p>

<p>Viazimski knit his bushy eyebrows. “Do you
know anything about the information of the
prisoner on your own account?” he grunted out,
turning over some papers.</p>

<p>Orloff let drop his half-eaten biscuit.</p>

<p>“Yes! Now, just fancy; you’ll not deny all
this is disgusting. My faithfulness, devotion,
honour, she has spared nothing.… And
let me tell you what is more astonishing than
everything else, that that she-devil fell over head
and ears in love with me, and invented, goodness
knows what; but even just now the hussy has
had the impudence to bid me acknowledge a
marriage with her.”</p>

<p>“Well! I can only wonder,” said Viazimski;
“that disguise in clerical vestments&mdash;excuse me,
what need for such sacrilege? Oh! you’ll have
a deal to answer for, to God, Batiushka Count.…
All that would haunt me.”</p>

<p>Orloff tried to turn it all off as a joke, tried to
go on talking, but the gloomy silence of the bear-like
Procureur showed him that his credit at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
court had been long on the decline, and that he,
notwithstanding his late services, might, like useless
old rubbish, hope for only one thing&mdash;to be
left alone and forgotten.</p>

<p>“My annals are finishing, it seems. I shall
soon be at the bottom of the river,” thought
Orloff, on leaving Viazimski. “They’ll put me
under hatches somewhere in Moscow, or perhaps
farther. We are grown old, out of fashion; we
must clear the way for new-comers.”</p>

<p>He was so much disturbed by his reception at
the procureur’s that the next morning he had a
special service celebrated in the Church of the
Holy Virgin Mary, and before his departure for
Moscow he even paid a visit to an Armenian
fortune-teller on the Litienaya.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>ORLOFF AT MOSCOW.</i></span></h3>

<p>The peace with Turkey was publicly celebrated
at Moscow on July 13th. Galitzin was not forgotten,
and, for having cleared Moldavia of the
Turks, received from Petersburg a rich sword
studded with diamonds. Orloff received a testimonial,
a rich dinner service, one of the Imperial
properties near Petersburg, and the title of
“Chesmenski.”</p>

<p>“Put up on the shelves of the archives, wholly
thrown over!” thought Alexis Gregorevitch. He
was not allowed to follow the court to Petersburg.
From this time Moscow was assigned to him as a
residence, as also to many of the other supporters
of Ekaterina. It would have seemed that the
days of Chesmenski flowed on peacefully and
pleasantly in his splendid Muscovite palace; but
the retainers of the count began to notice that
he often had fits of melancholy&mdash;that very often,
without any reason whatever, he would have funeral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
masses celebrated, or a special service with
<i>Acathistus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> or would call in the gipsy fortune-tellers,
and they would hear him often murmur
and complain of the “Traitress Fortune,” who in
former times had so spoilt him with her favours.</p>

<p>If Count Alexana would drive out his fleet
steeds on a beautiful frosty evening, flying along
the streets, glancing at the passers-by from under
his rich fur cap, thickly studded with frosty
diamonds, his thoughts would carry him back to
other blue, but warm skies, to the azure shores of
the Morea and the Adriatic, to the Roman and
Venetian marble palaces. If in autumn the sleet
were driving, promising a splendid hunt, the
count would ride in the neighbourhood of Otradi
or Niaskouchnavo, and, after having driven the
mother hare out of the birch copse, and started
his favourite harehounds on her track, would
gallop on his gallant Kabardinetz furiously in
pursuit, but all at once he would rein in his
steed and stop. The rain might brush the wet
branches of the birch in his face, the horse
might splash through the pools and mud, but the
count’s thoughts had wandered far away, to that
far-off Italy, to Rome, Livorno, to the unfortunate,
by him betrayed, Tarakanova.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where is she? What has become of her?”
he would think. “Has she survived her child’s
birth? Is she still there, or have they hidden
her even farther away?”</p>

<p>After the fall of the favourite, Prince Gregory,
his brother, Count Alexis Chesmenski, retired so
quickly from court that he not only knew
nothing positive, but even dared not try to know
anything positive about the unfortunate beauty
whom he had carried off and betrayed.</p>

<p>That same year, in autumn, rumours were
spread in Moscow that a very important mysterious
personage had been brought over from
Petersburg, and sequestered in the Novo Spaski
Nunnery; that she had been compelled to take
the veil, and had been named Docifé,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and was
now locked up in a secluded cell.</p>

<p>The Muscovites whispered loudly that the new
nun was the daughter of the late Empress Elizabeth,
by her secret husband Razoumovski.</p>

<p>What emotions the count underwent, are only
known to himself.</p>

<p>“It is she! it is she!” he would murmur in
his agitation, not knowing that his victim, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Princess Tarakanova, still hopelessly languished
in the fortress. “It can be no one else; of course
not. She has renounced everything, she has
submitted, she has taken the veil.”</p>

<p>Thoughts of the newly-arrived captive troubled
him so much that he even avoided driving in the
street where the convent was, and if this were
impossible, he would avoid looking up at the
windows.</p>

<p>“Traitor, murderer!” would resound in his
ears, on recollecting his last interview with the
Princess. In bitter anguish he would remember
every detail of that interview, when she had
loaded him with curses, stamped at him, spat in his
face, and passionately flung at him whatever came
near her hand. Once, when the Prince Volkonski
had paid him an unofficial visit, to see over his
stables and horses, Chesmenski tried to bring the
conversation round to the Princess. They had
returned from their walk to the stables, and
were taking tea. The count began in a roundabout
way to refer to foreign and home news, and
rumours, and then, as if merely <i lang="fr">en passant</i>, asked
who the person was whom report said had been
brought to the convent?</p>

<p>“Why do you ask that?” suddenly interrupted
the prince, Michael Nikititch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“What?” asked the bewildered Chesmenski.</p>

<p>“Nothing!” answered Volkonski, turning
round, and looking aimlessly out of the window.
“I was just recollecting a little Petersburg incident,
that happened last year at Court.”</p>

<p>“What incident? Honour me, Batiushka
Prince!” said the count, with a smile and a bow.
“You see, here I hear nothing and see nothing
of the new, curious, and to us very often incomprehensible
occurrences in the court regions?”</p>

<p>“Well! as you please,” said Volkonski, clearing
his throat, and continuing to gaze out of the
window. “The incident, if you like, is not very
important, rather comical than otherwise. You
know the wife of the General Major Kojin?
Marie Dimitrievna, who is so lively, so beautiful
and such a chatterbox?”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, who does not know her? I
often used to meet her, before my departure for
foreign parts.”</p>

<p>“Well! you know, she babbled out, it is
said, somewhere … that some one …
well! we’ll call them the Abaloshoffs, it’s all the
same, I’ve forgotten who&mdash;had decided on patronising
the new lucky man, Peter Modrvinoff.…
Of course you know.”</p>

<p>Orloff silently inclined his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“Patronise … well! you understand,
trip him up.…”</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Orloff.</p>

<p>“Well! it would seem Gregory Alexandrovitch
Potemkin.”</p>

<p>“Well! and what then?”</p>

<p>“Well! this,” continued the prince. “In
somebody’s private rooms, Stephan Ivanovitch
Sheshkovski was hurriedly called, and the
following orders were given:&mdash;‘Batiushka, go
immediately, this very minute, to the masquerade,
find out the <i lang="ru">Generalsha</i> Kojin. Having found
her, carry her off to the secret department, and
having given her a slight taste of corporal
punishment, as a small token of remembrance,
bring back the aforesaid little lady, with all
honour, and deliver her safely over to the masquerade.”</p>

<p>“And Sheshkovski?”</p>

<p>“Well! he took the little lady, whipped her
soundly, and brought her back, with all honour,
to the masquerade, and she, that no one should
get a hint of this curious little incident, said
nothing, and very wisely and assiduously went
through all the dances to which she had been
invited&mdash;every one to the last&mdash;minuet, <i lang="fr">cotillon</i>,
and all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Orloff understood well the bitter allusion, and
never mentioned Docifé again.</p>

<p>Neither did the count find any pleasure in his
conversations with his intendant, Terentitch
Cabanoff, who sometimes used to come from
Krenova to Niaskouchnavo. Terentitch was a
serf, but knew how to read and write. He was
always dressed in the latest fashion, with a
pearl-grey <i>kaftan</i><a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and waistcoat, shoes with
huge steel buckles, ruffles, and a black silk
purse<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> to his powdered pigtail.</p>

<p>The count would pour out for him a goblet
of rich foreign wine, saying, “Taste that, old
fellow.… It’s not wine I’ve poured out,
it’s a man’s life, … elixir.” Terentitch would
refuse.</p>

<p>“No! No nonsense, old man!” would press
the count. “Don’t forget the proverb, ‘Enjoy
life while it lasts.’ Be merry, in that alone lies
happiness. Unfortunately, not for all.”</p>

<p>“Too true, Batiushka Count!” would answer
Cabanoff, drinking off the goblet. “We, well!
we are but serfs; … but you, ought you
to sigh, ought you not to enjoy sweet life in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
own lovely, beautiful manors? The sites are
so dry, so gay, the sloping fields are so fruitful;
springs of water, forests, groves, everywhere.
The serfs so industrious, so hardy, no beggars,
thanks to you, our benefactor. We have noticed
long ago, sir, that you are always very sad, and
have heard something now and then which makes
us all very anxious.”</p>

<p>“Doubt and suspicion, my dear fellow, will
constantly exist,” answered the count. “Last
autumn, you yourself wrote to me, when I was
in foreign parts, praising the coming crops, and
how did they turn out? to be of no account at
all? No, the proverb says, ‘Don’t count your
chickens before they’re hatched!’”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s the truth you’re saying,” answered
Terentitch, sighing.</p>

<p>“And in all other things,” continued the count.
“I go about a great deal, and many come to me,
and, would you believe it? I know nothing of
what I used to know before. Phylia was high
in favour, every one sought his patronage, but
now, …” the count was silent and thoughtful.</p>

<p>“See there!” thought Cabanoff, looking at
him, “with that strength, those riches, to be
thus slighted.”</p>

<p>“Ah! yes, old man,” continued Orloff, “hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
times are come. I feel as if between two millstones.
My services are ended; no one requires
them any more, and here, at home, there is
nothing but <i lang="fr">ennui</i>.”</p>

<p>“Count, fire purifies gold,” answered Terentitch,
“misfortune, man. Wood won’t burn without
shavings.… I might look out for some
for you.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Get married, your Grace.”</p>

<p>“Oh! well, prate about that to others, but not
to me,” answered Chesmenski, remembering that
Konsov had given him the same advice not long
before.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>THE PRINCESS WRITES TO THE EMPRESS.</i></span></h3>

<p>Meanwhile, the position of the Princess Tarakanova
had remained the same. During the
celebration of the peace with Turkey, in Moscow,
she had been forgotten. However, when all had
become quiet again, new points of condemnation
were found against her. She was again cross-examined.
Even Sheshkovski was called, and
let loose on her, and the cross-examinations were
more frequent. Worn out by her illness and
mental anguish, as well as by her miserable and
unusual surroundings, and by the presence of
the two sentinels in her room, she began fading
rapidly. There were even days when her end
was expected every minute. After one of these
terrible days, the unfortunate captive seized a
pen, and wrote a letter to the empress.</p>

<p>“Snatching myself from the arms of death,”
she wrote, “I throw myself at your feet. You
ask, who I am? but can the fact of birth be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
made a crime of, for any one? Night and day
men are in my room. My sufferings are such
that my whole being is shaken. In refusing me
mercy, it’s not to me alone you refuse it.” The
empress was very much troubled that she could
not leave Moscow herself and personally see the
captive, who excited in her by turns the deepest
anger, and, involuntarily, the most profound
pity.</p>

<p>In the month of August, Field-Marshal
Galitzin paid the Princess another visit.</p>

<p>“You called yourself a Persian. Then you
said you were born in Arabia; you gave yourself
out next as a Tcherkeshenka; and at last as
our grand-duchess,” he said. “You stated that
you knew the Oriental languages; we gave your
letters to persons who know those languages, but
they could make nothing out of them. Is it
possible&mdash;excuse me&mdash;that this is also deceit on
your part?”</p>

<p>“Oh! how stupid all that is!” answered
Tarakanova, with a contemptuous smile, and again
coughing. “Do Persians and Arabs teach their
wives to read or write? In my childhood I
learnt a little by myself, and therefore I ought to
be believed more than your readers.”</p>

<p>Galitzin was too sorry for her to go on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
questioning her on all the points written down
by Oushakoff.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said he, dashing away a tear,
seeming to recollect something which was a great
deal more serious and important, “there’s no
time for disputes now … your strength is
failing you.… I have not received permission;
yet I will give orders for you to be transferred
into a better and more spacious apartment,
and your food shall be brought you from the
table of the commandant.… Would you
not like a priest … you understand …
we are all in the hands of God … to prepare
you … for.…”</p>

<p>“For death … is it not true?” interrupted
the captive, shaking her head.</p>

<p>“Yes!” answered Galitzin.</p>

<p>“Yes, I feel myself it is true.”</p>

<p>“Whom would you like?” asked the prince,
leaning over her. “A Catholic, a Protestant, or
one of our own faith?”</p>

<p>“I am Russian,” said the Princess, “therefore
send me one of our own faith, if you please.”</p>

<p>“So, everything is finished!” thought she the
next night, sleepless as always; “darkness without
dawn, anguish without end, death …
there it comes. It will soon be here, soon&mdash;perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
to-morrow. And they’re not yet tired
of questioning.…”</p>

<p>The captive arose, leaned her head on the side
of the bed. “But who am I after all?” she asked
herself, raising her eyes to the image of the
Saviour. “Is it so difficult to sum up everything
in these my last minutes? Perhaps.&mdash;Is
it possible that I am not really the one I thought
myself to be? No, I do not acknowledge that!
But why not? Is it from a feeling of disgust
towards them, or from too great a passion; or is
it revenge for a name disgraced, for a woman
crushed?”</p>

<p>And then she tried again to remember all her
past, to recollect its smallest details. Days long
past crowded her memory. Her luxurious gay life,
her successes, her triumphs, her visits and her
levées, her balls. “Courtiers, <i lang="fr">diplomâts</i>, counts,
even reigning princes; how many adorers I
have had,” thought she. “There must have been
some reason why they should all have courted me
so, offered me their hearts, their riches, sought my
hand.… For what? for my beauty, for
my power of pleasing, for my talents? But there
are many beautiful, talented women far more
wily than I; why did not the Prince Limbourski
go mad over them? Why did he not give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
them, as he gave me, his lands, his castles?
Why didn’t he make these over to them instead
of to me, as ‘granted’ estates? Why only to me
did all the ‘Radzivills’ and ‘Pototskis’ cling?
Even the powerful favourite of the Russian
Court, Shouvaloff, sought an interview with me.
Why was I surrounded with such profound,
almost devotional respect? Why was my past
history so eagerly searched out? Yes, I was
selected by Providence for some special end, of
which I myself am ignorant.</p>

<p>“Childhood!&mdash;there alone lies the key to it
all,” whispered the poor captive, grasping at
her earliest recollections; “there alone lie the
proofs.”</p>

<p>But it was just that very childhood which was
so bewildering to her own mind. She recollected
the isolated hamlet somewhere in the South, in a
desert, the large shady trees, the low cottage, the
kitchen garden, and beyond, the boundless fields.
A good, kind old woman dressed and took care of
her. Then came the journey in the comfortably
balanced cart, filled with fresh, perfumed hay,
other boundless fields, rivers, mountains, forests.
“But who am I?” she would cry in anguish,
sobbing and striking her poor senseless head!
“They want proofs!&mdash;but where are these to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
be found? What can I add to what I have
already said? How can I myself separate the
truth from the fiction which life has mixed up together?
And how could a poor, weak, deserted,
helpless child know that one day she would be
called to account for her own birth? The judgment
concerning me is unjust, illegal. It’s not
for me to help to convince my persecutors. Let
them disgrace me; let them hunt me down; let
them finish their work; I am not answerable,
either for my birth, or for my name.… I
am the only living witness of my past; there is
no other. Why are they so furious? God does
many wonders. Is it possible that He, to avenge
a poor, persecuted creature, will not perform a
miracle, will not open the door of this stone coffin,
of this awful fatal dungeon?”</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>FATHER PETER ANDRÉEF.</i></span></h3>

<p>The last warm days of autumn had already
passed, and cold and gloomy November had
brought its rains and mists.</p>

<p>Father Peter Andréef, the high priest of the
Cathedral of Kazan, was a man in the prime of
life, highly educated and well read.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1775 he was expecting from
Tchernigoff, his niece and god-daughter Vâra.
She had written to her uncle, that she would
arrive in Petersburg with a companion, a young
lady, who was coming in the hope of presenting
personally to the empress a petition on a very
important subject. The little house of Father
Peter, with an <i lang="fr">entresol</i>,<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and a <i lang="fr">perron</i> standing
out in the street, was built behind the cathedral,
and stood by the side of the palace of the
Hetman, Razoumovski. The old oaks and the
lindens threw their shade over its red-tiled roof,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
even extending their wide-spreading branches
over the priest’s little yard.</p>

<p>A widower for already several years, the
childless Father Peter led the life of a hermit.
His gates were always closed, and an enormous
watch-dog, Polkan, on hearing the slightest noise
would bark in the most furious fashion. The
few and far between visitors who wished to
speak to the priest always came through the
street-door, which was also kept constantly closed.
The letter of his niece gave a great deal of
pleasure to Father Peter, but he also found in
it something very extraordinary. Vâra wrote to
him, that the young mistress of the neighbouring
estate had a little while ago received from
abroad, together with a letter addressed to her,
a packet of papers covered with writing, which,
as the letter told her, had been found on the sea-shore
in a bottle. “Dear godfather and uncle,
forgive my foolishness,” wrote Vâra to her uncle,
“but after having read these papers together, the
young lady and I have decided on coming to
Petersburg, and we shall soon be there. Whom
could I recommend the unfortunate orphan to
go to if not you. She buried her parents a year
ago. In the papers sent her there is so much
concerning an important person, that before deciding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
on speaking about it, there is a great deal
to think over. First, the young lady thought
of sending the papers to Moscow, to the empress,
but on reflection we decided otherwise. You,
dear uncle, know everything. You go everywhere,
you are respected by every one, therefore
you can easily advise us what to do. The
name of the young lady is Irena Lvovna, and
her surname&mdash;she is the daughter of the
Brigadier Rakitin.”</p>

<p>“Ah! youth, youth!” thoughtfully shaking
his head, said the priest on reading this letter.
“Ah! the magpies, what crazy ideas! to come
all the way from Tchernigoff to Petersburg to
get my advice.… They’ve fallen&mdash;well&mdash;they’ve
found some one!”</p>

<p>Every evening, at twilight, Father Peter was
wont to light the candles, and having put on
his house cassock, to walk up and down the
little linen drugget which ran through all the
rooms, from the little hall, through the drawing-room,
dining-room, and into the bedroom. He
would look after his plants, especially his geraniums,
standing on the window-sills; pull off the
dry leaves and pick out the weeds; and would
arrange the books on the table, and gaze at his
favourite blackbird asleep in its cage, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
“ikons” and images in the corner, at the lighted
lamp, and would begin musing and thinking&mdash;when
at last would those rooms be filled
with mirth and life, when would his magpie
come?</p>

<p>The two girls arrived. The house of the priest
became at once bright and lively. The sprightly
gay Vârushka quite bewildered her uncle with
news about his birthplace, their acquaintances, and
journey adventures. Listening to her, Father
Peter thought within himself, “How time flies!
Is it so long ago that she was brought here, a
wild, snub-nosed, and sulky little lass? and now&mdash;look
at her, so sprightly, so gay, so clever!
Yes, and her companion, she is a beauty! Those
thick black braids, and what eyes! But quite
in another style to my Vâra; so thoughtful, discreet,
serious and proud!”</p>

<p>After the first joyful questions and answers,
the priest was obliged to celebrate the vesper
service, and his visitors having hastily established
themselves in the attic, took everything that was
necessary, and started for the bath, accompanied
by the cook. On returning home they established
themselves in the corner by the fireside, and
there Father Peter found them, as red as boiled
lobsters, their heads tied up with coloured handkerchiefs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
drinking tea. It was long past midnight
when they at last rose to go to bed.</p>

<p>“Well! my young lady, and where are the
papers you have brought with you?” said Father
Peter, rising. “It interests me also; what is
it all about?”</p>

<p>The girls began searching in their bundles,
found the roll&mdash;on it was the inscription, “Diary
of Lieutenant Konsov.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>THE VISITORS’ QUEST.</i></span></h3>

<p>Father Peter retired to his chamber, drew the
curtains, put the candle on the night-table, threw
himself without undressing on the bed, unrolled
the crumpled manuscript of blue foreign note-paper
with gilt edges, and began reading. He
did not close his eyes till morning.</p>

<p>The whole history of the Princess Tarakanova,
or Princess Wladimirskaya, of which Father Peter
had only heard the most contradictory rumours,
was now open to him, with unexpected details.</p>

<p>“Ah! that is what it is about,” he thought,
on reading the first lines; “about the mysterious
Princess.”</p>

<p>Sometimes he would leave off reading the
manuscripts, and lie with closed eyes, then again
begin to read. “And where now is that poor
unfortunate, betrayed girl?” he asked himself,
on reading the incident of Livorno. “Where is
she now dragging out her miserable existence?
And he, who wrote these lines, was he saved?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>One candle after another burnt out. Father
Peter finished the manuscript, snuffed out the
last little piece of candle, and began walking up
and down on the drugget. He went on walking
till dawn reminded him that he had not slept all
night. “What events! ah! what events! What
an unfortunate tissue of incidents!” whispered
the priest. “Poor martyr! May God help her!”</p>

<p>The blackbird in the cage woke up, and seeing
the very unusual promenade of its master, set
up a loud unwonted scream.</p>

<p>“He’ll wake every one up,” thought the priest.</p>

<p>He returned on tiptoe to his bedroom, threw
himself on his bed, and began reflecting on all
that he had read. His thoughts wandered to the
last reign, to the sea of mysterious and common
events, known to others as well as to him; at
last he fell asleep.</p>

<p>The sound of the bells ringing for morning
service awoke him. The pale November sun
was struggling through the curtains. Father
Peter locked up the manuscript in the drawer of
his table, went to church to celebrate morning
service, and returned home, through the back
door, into the kitchen. On seeing his god-daughter
going up the attic stairs with a hot iron
in her hands he beckoned her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tell me, Vâra,” he whispered; “he who
wrote that diary&mdash;Konsov&mdash;must, it’s plain, have
been her <i lang="fr">fiancé</i>?”</p>

<p>Vâra moistened her finger and then touched
the hot iron; it fizzed.</p>

<p>“He did woo her,” she answered, dangling her
iron.</p>

<p>“Well! and what then?”</p>

<p>“Well! Irena Lvovna liked him. Her father
would not hear of it.”</p>

<p>“Then the match was broken off?”</p>

<p>“Of course!”</p>

<p>“And now?”</p>

<p>“Well, what can I say? She is an orphan
now, and of course would be delighted. She is
her own mistress&mdash;but where is he?”</p>

<p>“Oh! of course the ship was wrecked,” said
Father Peter.</p>

<p>“And in our wilderness, what could we learn
about it? Uncle, you might go and make some
inquiries of naval people, because, you see, not
only the command was lost, but all the count’s
riches.… Somewhere, you would be sure
to learn something.”</p>

<p>“Who sent your friend this diary?”</p>

<p>“God alone knows. The post brought it;
Irisha received it. On the roll was only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
‘Rakitin,’ and the address; and in the note, written
in French, it was merely said that the manuscript
had been found by some fishermen in a bottle
on the sea-shore. Irena is now the only survivor
of Rakitin … and so of course she received it.”</p>

<p>The priest, without saying anything either to
his niece or her friend, began most energetically
to make inquiries in all directions, but his efforts
were fruitless.</p>

<p>The only information he gained at the Marine
Department was that the frigate, <i>The Northern
Eagle</i>, which was laden with the rich collections
of Count Orloff, had been driven along into the
Atlantic Ocean&mdash;it had been seen for some time
beyond Gibraltar, near the African coast, not far
off from Tangiers&mdash;and that in all probability it
had been shipwrecked and sunk not far from the
Azores or the Canaries. Of the fate of Lieutenant
Konsov nothing could be gathered; it was
not even known for a surety whether he was on
the frigate or not, as the whole of the crew had
perished. The commander of the squadron, and
Admiral Greig, were both now in Moscow, and
there remained no one else to apply to. There
had been some rumours in foreign newspapers
that a disabled ship had been seen somewhere
about on the ocean, but with no crew on board,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
as far as could be noticed; it was being driven
by the storm in the direction of the Azores or
Madeira. The violence of the storm had effectually
prevented any efforts being made to rescue it.</p>

<p>“Poor young girl!” thought the priest, looking
at Rakitina; “so clever, so modest, so rich,
and so young. They would have been a couple,
if God had only spared him! No, he must be
dead. Had he been alive, he would have sent
some token to his native land, to his fellow
officers, to his relations.”</p>

<p>Once, when he had some spare time, he took
the opportunity of speaking with Irena.</p>

<p>“Young lady,” said he, “I have heard from
my niece of your loss. Of course, it is plain your
enemies had their own reasons for separating
you from your wooer and giving you another.
Why did it all happen? Why was Konsov
treated with such disdain?”</p>

<p>“I know not myself,” answered Irena. “My
late father was very fond of Pavel Efstafitch, was
always very kind to him, treated him not only as
a near neighbour, but as one dear to him. And
I, what words can describe my love for him? I
lived only in his love.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, how came this separation about?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t ask me,” said Irena, covering her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
face with her hands. “It is such anguish to me&mdash;such
grief. We saw each other often, corresponded;
we used to have meetings. I gave
him my word; we were only awaiting a fitting
time to tell all to my father.”</p>

<p>Rakitina was silent for some minutes.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is dreadful to recollect it all!” she
continued. “I suppose some one must have
calumniated Konsov to my father. All at once&mdash;it
was evening&mdash;I saw the horses being put to
the carriage. ‘Where to?’ I asked. My father
would answer nothing. My things were carried
out, put into the carriage. At that time a relative
from Petersburg was on a visit to us. We
three took our seats in the carriage. ‘Where
to?’ I again asked my father. ‘Oh, hereabouts,
not very far; we will just have a drive,’ said my
father, joking. Yes; it turned out a nice joke!
We went on with post-horses, without one relay,
as far as our other property, one thousand versts<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
distant. I could neither write nor send any
message to Konsov for a long time, I was watched
so closely. It was only when my father fell
dangerously ill that I implored him not to break
my heart, but to allow me to write to Konsov.
He began crying bitterly, and said, ‘Forgive me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Irisha. We have both been deceived cruelly.’
‘What? what?’ I could only ask. ‘Is it possible
that that cousin sought my hand?’</p>

<p>“‘Not your hand, my dear, but the money,’
my father said. ‘He intercepted one of Konsov’s
letters to you, and so stirred up my anger against
him, that I decided on carrying you off. Forgive
me, Irenushka, forgive me. God has punished
him, the wicked one. He borrowed a large sum
from me, lost it at cards in Moscow, and has blown
his brains out. He left a letter … there it
is, read it … I received it a few days ago.’</p>

<p>“My poor father did not live long after this.
I returned to my own property, but of Konsov
I could get no tidings. His grandmother was
also dead. I wrote to Petersburg, whence he had
started, wrote into foreign parts, to the fleet; but
then war was raging, and of course he did not
get my letters. Then his captivity in Turkey
… then … and that is all my sad fate.”</p>

<p>“Pray, my dear young lady, pray,” said the
priest. “Your lot is a bitter one; only the good
God above can help you.”</p>

<p>Meantime, several days passed by. Rakitina,
ceaselessly without respite, went about gathering
all the information she could, regretting neither
time nor money, but all was of no avail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can see, Irena Lvovna,” said Father Peter
to his guest one day, “that you are constantly
going about, first to one, then to another, troubling
yourself and all for nothing. I have heard
it said that the empress will not be here for some
time yet; why should you not write to the
superior officer of Pavel Efstafitch, to Moscow?
may not the Count Orloff know of something?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Father,” answered Rakitina, bowing.
“Let us pray God that we may learn something
about that unfortunate ship without a crew,
and if no one else were saved, perhaps Konsov.…
Yesterday Count Pânin promised me to
get some information from a foreign Marine
Department&mdash;in Spain&mdash;in Madeira; Von Viesing,
the author, has also offered his services. Shall
I not hear of something? I shall wait a little
longer; still I ought to be going home, but how
can I go without any hope! Oh! that unfortunate
ship, it haunts me night and day!…”</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>A LATE VISITOR.</i></span></h3>

<p>The evening of the 1st of December, 1775, was
particularly wet and windy. The snow which
had fallen in the morning was now all melted;
there were pools of water everywhere; the few
and far between carriages and pedestrians gloomily
splashed along the streets. There was a storm.
The wind howled over the house of the priest,
shaking the shutters, and bending the enormous
trees in the garden of the Hetman. The Neva
was swollen; an inundation was imminent. From
time to time could be heard the gloomy sound of
the cannon from the fortress.</p>

<p>Father Peter was in the attic with the girls,
and very thoughtful. The conversation could not
be kept up to the accompaniment of the howling
wind; it frequently had to be broken. Vâra was
telling the cards; Irena appeared very displeased,
and was relating with a very discontented face
what leeches the secretaries in the Foreign Department
were, the interpreters, and even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
very scribes. Notwithstanding the orders and
personal interest of Count Pânin, they had as
yet done nothing in Spain or on the islands.
Projects were made on paper, copied, translated,
everything, only to drag on.</p>

<p>“You should just oil a little … through
the servants, or somehow,” said the priest.</p>

<p>“Oh! she gave without stint,” answered Vâra
for her friend.</p>

<p>“Oh! those laggards,” said Father Peter.
“Yes, it’s high time our empress should return
from Moscow. We are badly off without her.”</p>

<p>The rain beat furiously on the windows like
hail. The poor trembling drenched dog had
hidden himself in his kennel, as though acknowledging
that in such a storm, and with the cannon
firing, no one would take the trouble to disturb
him. All at once, after one of the booms of the
cannon from the fortress, the dog began to bark
most angrily, and, above the roar of the wind,
the noise of the shutting of the gate was distinctly
heard. Both girls shivered.</p>

<p>“Axenia is asleep,” said Father Peter, speaking
of the cook. “Some one wants me, I suppose,
and could not make himself heard at the
front door.”</p>

<p>“Uncle, I’ll go and open it,” said Vâra.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! with your courage! You’d better sit
still.”</p>

<p>The priest, taking the candle in his hand, went
down and opened the door. There entered a not
very tall, but stout man, with a red face. He
had a cocked hat and sword, and seemed as if
he had got rather wet while waiting at the
<i lang="fr">perron</i> to have the door opened.</p>

<p>“Secretary to the commander-in-chief, Oushakoff,”
said he, shaking himself. “I am come
to you on a secret mission.”</p>

<p>The priest felt a little frightened. He remembered
the papers brought by Rakitina. He shut
the door, and invited his guest into the study,
lighted a second candle, and having given his
visitor a chair, took one himself and sat down
to listen.</p>

<p>“‘The Sermons of Massillon’?” said Oushakoff,
rubbing his cold hands, and looking at the book
of celebrated sermons lying on Father Peter’s
table. “Then I suppose you know the French
language well?”</p>

<p>“I understand it a little,” said the priest,
thinking within himself, “What can he want with
me at this late hour?”</p>

<p>“Very probably, Batiushka, you understand
German also; and, who knows, perhaps Italian?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>“I learnt German, and of course Italian resembles
Latin very closely.”</p>

<p>“Consequently,” continued the stranger, “you
know a little of those languages?”</p>

<p>“Well! here’s a Preceptor come to examine
me,” thought the priest.</p>

<p>“Yes! a little,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Is it not strange, Father Peter, such questions;
especially in the middle of the night?”
said the stranger. “Now, confess; you do find
it strange?”</p>

<p>“Yes! it is rather late,” said the priest, gaping
and looking at him.</p>

<p>Oushakoff crossed one leg over the other, and
looking up to the wall, saw a portrait of the then
disgraced Archbishop Arsénia Matzaevitch, and
thought to himself, “Ah! well, he sympathises
with that scoundrel. I shall have to be very
determined with him, very brusque!”</p>

<p>“I will not delay any longer,” said he. “This
is what it is. His Grace, the commander-in-chief,
desires your Right Reverence to take all
the necessary vessels, and immediately, without
any delay, to follow me … to a foreigner&mdash;of
the Grecian Faith.…”</p>

<p>“But what is all this about?”</p>

<p>“To celebrate two Sacraments.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>“But which?”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, but is it necessary for you to
know, beforehand?” answered Oushakoff. “There
must be no hesitation. The orders come from
high powers.”</p>

<p>“I must get everything ready,” answered the
priest, “so I must know which.”</p>

<p>“First Baptism, then Confession, and Holy
Communion,” answered Oushakoff.</p>

<p>“Now, in the night?”</p>

<p>“Just so. A carriage is waiting.”</p>

<p>“May I take the clerk?”</p>

<p>“The orders are, ‘without any witnesses.’”</p>

<p>“Where is it, if I may ask?”</p>

<p>“I cannot answer. You will know all afterwards.
Now, only one thing; there must be no
delay, and the most profound secrecy,” said
Oushakoff, with a haughty inclination of his head,
although in earnest of his request, he pressed
with both his hands his cocked hat, dripping
with the rain, to his breast.</p>

<p>“May I at least tell my household, and allay
their anxiety?”</p>

<p>Oushakoff knit his brows, and silently shook
his head. The priest took the cross and books,
called to Vâra in the attic to shut the door, and
by the time his niece had descended, the carriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
was rolling noisily away in the street. Driving
up to the palings of the church, Father Peter
woke up the clerk, went into the church, and
took the chalice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>BAPTISM.</i></span></h3>

<p>The carriage stopped at the house of the Commander-in-Chief
Galitzin. The prince was informed
of the arrival of the priest, and ordered
him to be brought to his bedroom, where he was
awaiting him in his dressing-gown.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Mille pardons</i>, Batiushka,” said the prince,
hurriedly dressing. “Most important affair;
by orders of the highest authority. You must
first give me your oath that you will be silent
for ever on everything heard and seen this night.
Do you swear?”</p>

<p>“As one offering up a bloodless sacrifice,”
answered Father Peter, “I will be faithful to
my Sovereign, without any oaths.”</p>

<p>Galitzin was a little embarrassed at first, but
he did not insist. He related to the priest a
few of the circumstances concerning the captive.</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear anything of her before?”
he asked the priest.</p>

<p>“Yes! a few rumours did reach me.…”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you heard that she is now in Petersburg?”</p>

<p>“I hear it for the first time.”</p>

<p>Galitzin told him of the anxiety of the empress,
of the several foreign inimical parties, and
of the false wills.</p>

<p>“The doctor has quite given her up,” added
the field-marshal. “Not only her days, but
her hours are numbered.”</p>

<p>Father Peter crossed himself.</p>

<p>“She wishes to be prepared,” continued the
prince, as if choosing his words. “It is not
for me to teach you what to do. Most probably,
like a good shepherd, you will lead her to a full
Confession and Repentance as to who she is,
and if she has taken a name not belonging to
her, and who incited her to do it?… Will
you do this?”</p>

<p>The priest lingered with his answer.</p>

<p>“Give your word that you will help justice.”</p>

<p>“I know my duty and my obligations as
minister of God,” answered Father Peter, drily,
coughing.</p>

<p>“You may go,” said the prince, bowing.
“You will be conducted where you are needed.
As to me, I hope you will excuse the trouble
I have given you at such a late hour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>The carriage, with the priest and Oushakoff,
took the road to the fortress. At the door of
the commandant’s they noticed another carriage.</p>

<p>The priest was led into a special room, where
he saw the Général Procureur, Prince Viazimski.
Near the prince stood the tall, manly, ruddy-faced
commandant of the fortress, Tchernishoff,
and, near the latter, his still young-looking and
smartly dressed wife.</p>

<p>“Is everything ready?” asked Viazimski,
looking round.</p>

<p>“Everything is ready,” answered the <i lang="ru">Commandantsha</i>,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
trembling and bowing in her
rustling farthingale.</p>

<p>“Be so good as …” said the Prince
Viazimski to the priest.</p>

<p>They all went into the next room, where
candles in the tall silver candlesticks had already
been lighted. Between them stood a font, and
near it a woman, commonly dressed, and holding
in her arms something wrapped in white.</p>

<p>“Begin, Holy Father,” said Viazimski, pointing
to the font and to what the woman held.</p>

<p>Father Peter put on his vestments, took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
censer from the hands of Tchernishoff, opened
the Prayer-Book, and began the ceremony.</p>

<p>The sponsors were the finely dressed, affected
wife of the commandant, and the général procureur
himself.</p>

<p>They gave the newly christened babe the name of
Alexander. The ceremony was finished; the <i lang="ru">commandantsha</i>,
with the babe in her arms, continued
turning and twisting about, trying with her airs
and graces to attract the attention of the général
procureur to herself and her rustling silk dress.</p>

<p>“Whose child?” asked the priest, lowering his
voice, and respectfully inclining the cross towards
the godfather, who drew near.</p>

<p>Viazimski looked at him, quite taken aback.</p>

<p>“Under what name must I inscribe him in the
register?” asked Father Peter. “Who are the
parents?”</p>

<p>“But is that absolutely necessary?” asked
the général procureur, in a displeased voice.</p>

<p>“As you may order.… By right, the ceremony
requires it. Who knows what may happen
in the future?… We are bound.…”</p>

<p>“Right,” said Viazimski. “Alexander Alexéef,
son of Chesmenski.”</p>

<p>The priest silently, with a trembling hand,
inscribed the name in the baptismal register.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now another Sacrament.… Here is your
guide,” said the Prince Viazimski sighing, pointing
to the smart commandant, who was standing
drawn up to his full height. “I hope that
everything will be fulfilled according to orders.”</p>

<p>With these words, he left the room and drove
home.</p>

<p>Father Peter, holding the chalice to his breast,
followed Tchernishoff. His heart beat faster
when, having crossed the little bridge in the
interior, they entered a special yard, surrounded
by a high wall. He at once understood that they
had entered the fatal Ravelin of Alexéef.…</p>

<p>The priest and his guide, mounting a few steps,
entered a long, dimly lighted corridor, and stopped
before a low door.</p>

<p>“She is here,” whispered the priest to himself.
The door led into a rather low but very comfortable
room. There were no sentinels now.
The candle near the bed shed a feeble light on
the other part of the room, through a purposely
arranged silk curtain. The room was close, and
a faint odour of medicine and incense pervaded
it. The priest glanced around, and silently
stepped behind the screen.</p>

<p>The sick girl lay motionless on her bed, but
was quite conscious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>She slowly raised her eyes to the visitor, and
recognising that it was the priest by his dress,
gently sighed, and held out her hand.</p>

<p>“I am very, very glad, Holy Father,” she whispered
in French. “Perhaps you would prefer
German?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Oui! Oui, comme il vous plaît</i>,” stammered
Father Peter, shivering involuntarily at the
sound of that deep, broken contralto.</p>

<p>“I am ready; ask,” stammered the captive.
“Pray for me.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>CONFESSION AND ABSOLUTION.</i></span></h3>

<p>The priest carefully put the chalice on the table,
drew a chair near the bed, passed his fingers
through his bushy hair, and glancing at the
image over the head of the sick girl, gently bent
over her.</p>

<p>“Your name?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Princess Elizabeth.…”</p>

<p>“I conjure you, speak the truth,” continued
Father Peter, trying to recollect the French
words. “Who were your parents, and where
were you born?”</p>

<p>“I swear by the Almighty God that I do not
know,” answered the captive, with a hollow
cough. “I knew and believed only what others
told me.”</p>

<p>She answered all the other questions in a voice
broken and so low as to be scarcely heard. She
touched lightly on her childhood, the South of
Russia, the village where she had lived, Siberia,
her flight to Persia, and her residence in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are a Christian?” asked the priest.</p>

<p>“I was baptized into the Russian faith, and
therefore look upon myself as belonging to the
Russian Church, although until now, for many
reasons, I have been deprived of the blessings
of Confession and Holy Communion.… I
have sinned a great deal. Trying to tear myself
from my awful position, I gave my friendship to
people who only betrayed me.… Oh, how
thankful I am for your visit!”</p>

<p>“Among your papers were found two wills.…
From whom did you receive them, and&mdash;hide
nothing from God and from me&mdash;by whom was
your Manifesto to the Russian fleet written?”</p>

<p>“All that was sent to me quite ready by persons
quite unknown to me,” said the sick girl.
“I had secret friends who pitied me. They tried
to restore to me my lost rights.”</p>

<p>“But what is this?” thought the bewildered
priest, listening to her. “Is all this fiction or
truth? If this is deceit, my God, at what a
moment!”</p>

<p>“You are on the borders of the grave,” said he,
in a trembling voice; “on the verge of eternity.…
Repent.… Between us there is
only one witness&mdash;God.”</p>

<p>The penitent struggled within herself. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
bosom rose and fell, and her hand convulsively
clutched her handkerchief and held it to her
lips.</p>

<p>“In expectation of God’s judgment and my
near death,” said she, turning her eyes to the
image of the Saviour, “I confess and swear that
all that I have told you and others is the truth.
I know nothing more.…”</p>

<p>“But all this is impossible,” said Father Peter,
in an agitated voice. “All that you have told me
is so very improbable.”</p>

<p>The poor girl closed her eyes, as if from unendurable
acute suffering. Large tears rolled down
her thin and faded cheeks.</p>

<p>“Who were your accomplices?” asked the
priest, after a short pause.</p>

<p>“Oh, no one! Have pity, have mercy; …
and if I, weak, persecuted, without means.…”</p>

<p>The Princess did not finish. A hollow cough
shook her frame. She suddenly raised herself,
clutched at her breast, at the bed, and fell back,
apparently lifeless.</p>

<p>The fainting fit lasted several minutes. Father
Peter, thinking she was dying, began reading the
prayers. The sick girl came to herself.</p>

<p>“Do not agitate yourself; be calm,” said the
priest, noticing she was coming to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I cannot any more! Leave me! Go
away!” murmured the sick girl. “Another time.…
Let me rest.”</p>

<p>“I have just christened your son,” said the
priest, wishing to give her a little courage. “I
wish you joy for him. God is merciful; you may
yet live for him.…”</p>

<p>A faint smile came on the poor parched lips
of the captive. Her eyes wandered aimlessly
around, as though seeing beyond that room, that
fortress, beyond everything surrounding her, far
away.…</p>

<p>Father Peter blessed the poor girl, gazed at her
for some time, took the chalice, and having postponed
the celebration of the Holy Communion,
left the room.</p>

<p>“Well! what?” asked the commandant, who
was waiting for him in the corridor; “has she
confessed, communicated?”</p>

<p>The priest inclined his head, silently bowed to
the commandant, entered the carriage, and left
the Ravelin.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 2nd of December, he
was asked to come to the fortress, and to bring
the Elements of the Eucharist with him. The
sick girl was fading rapidly.</p>

<p>“Think well, my daughter, and ease your soul,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
by repentance,” extorted the priest. “I conjure
you, in the name of God, for the sake of the
future life!”</p>

<p>“I am a sinner,” answered the dying girl, in
a strangely quiet voice; “from my very youth
I have sinned against God, and feel myself to be
a great impenitent sinner.”</p>

<p>“I absolve thee from thy sins, my daughter,”
said the priest, devoutly praying and blessing
her; “but thy Pretendership, thy sins against
the empress,&mdash;thy accomplices?”</p>

<p>“I am a Russian grand-duchess! the daughter
of the late empress,” faintly murmured the
captive, hardly moving her benumbed lips. The
priest bent over her to administer the Sacrament;
but the captive lay motionless, almost lifeless.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>“WHAT IF THE CAPTIVE BE INNOCENT?”</i></span></h3>

<p>Father Peter returned home in a very agitated
frame of mind. “Is she a usurper?” thought
he. “Of course, man will stick to anything in his
own interests. But dying&mdash;almost with her last
breath, after such terrible privations, almost torture!
What if she’s innocent, not an adventuress?
remembers her childhood, repeats always
the same&mdash;of course, in all this, she is the only
witness. Is it her fault that her proofs are so
scanty, so insignificant?”</p>

<p>The priest, on coming home, went straight to
his study. Having learnt that the girls were not
at home, he lighted his stove, shut the door, and
once more took the diary of Konsov in his hands.
Having again glanced over the manuscript, he
wrapped it in a sheet of paper, tied it round with
a string, sealed it, and wrote on the outside paper&mdash;“To
be opened only after my death.” This
roll he put at the bottom of a trunk, where he
kept many precious documents and manuscripts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
He had hardly shut the lid down, when a knock
was heard at the door.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?”</p>

<p>“Friends!” and his niece entered with Rakitina.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you, dear uncle,”
asked Vâra, looking at the priest; “you look
agitated&mdash;this is the second day you’ve been out
driving?…”</p>

<p>Irena looked at him inquiringly. “Perhaps he
has some news for me,” thought she.</p>

<p>“About other people’s business; of no interest
to you, my dear; and you, Irena Lvovna, be
magnanimous and forgive me,” continued the
priest, turning round to Rakitina. “Times are
troublous, it is now too dangerous to keep the
manuscripts you brought from home. I know
you will soon go away, but the village even is not
safe. You’ll forgive an old man.”</p>

<p>Irena turned pale.</p>

<p>“All sorts of rumours are floating about&mdash;search
may be made,” continued Father Peter.
“Scold me, young lady, but your manuscript.…”</p>

<p>“Where is it? oh, you’ve not burnt it?”
cried Irena, involuntarily glancing at the lighted
stove.</p>

<p>Father Peter silently bowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Irena clasped her hands.</p>

<p>“Oh! my God!” she cried, unable to keep
back her tears; “the last consolation, the last
token of remembrance, and that is gone! What
shall I carry away with me now?”</p>

<p>Vâra looked reproachfully at her uncle.</p>

<p>“Afterwards, dear young lady; in time you
shall know everything, but now it is better to be
silent,” said the priest in a decided voice. “God’s
ways are not our ways. The enemy’s path is full
of snares. Pray to God; He will have mercy.”</p>

<p>But the priest was not to be left in peace.
That very day he was again called to the commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>“Well, did you get anything from the captive?”
asked Galitzin.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, your Grace,” answered Father
Peter, “but the secrets of the Confession.…
No! I cannot, I dare not.”</p>

<p>Galitzin became embarrassed.</p>

<p>“What a commission!” thought Galitzin, blushing.
“Ah, those counsellors.… Orloff,
you can see, unable to rest, is again inventing
something at Moscow, and I&mdash;play the Inquisitor.…”</p>

<p>“Well, Batiushka! that’s my orders from
high.…”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“I cannot, your Grace; ’twould be against
my conscience.”</p>

<p>Galitzin moved his lips, not finding a way out
of his embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Who <em>is</em> she?” said he, trying to look very
important and determined. “Cannot you see this
is a State secret, a most important one. You see
I must send a report. There will be inquiries;
I’m answerable for everything, for order. Here,
I … I alone!”</p>

<p>“One thing I may tell your Grace&mdash;while I am
alive, I’ll keep the oath exacted by you.”</p>

<p>The field-marshal was all ears.</p>

<p>“I’ll not let one word fall of what I heard at
the Confession,” continued Father Peter. “You
exacted from me an oath of silence, but I can
inform you of one thing, prince, although it is
my own personal opinion: the captive has been
much calumniated, a great deal has been invented,
… and what if she.…”</p>

<p>“Oh! speak, speak!” said the field-marshal.</p>

<p>“What if the captive were innocent?” said the
priest; “why should she suffer all that?”</p>

<p>If a thunderbolt had fallen at the feet of the
prince, he could not have been more wonderstruck.</p>

<p>“You assure me&mdash;do you mean to say, that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
had no accomplices?” said he; “that she was
no traitor? But then, am I to understand that
she is our own truly born grand-duchess! But
is it possible? No, not for one minute can I
think it!”</p>

<p>Father Peter, with his head bent down, was
silent.</p>

<p>“No! you make a mistake, that’s all a dream,
delirium,” cried out the field-marshal, clutching
at the bell rope. “Horses!” he called to the
orderly, who at once came in, “I’ll try; time is
not yet quite lost. I’ll see for myself.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>RELEASE.</i></span></h3>

<p>“Oh! I myself have sinned against her in my
reports,” thought Galitzin, on his way to the
fortress. “I fell under the influence of others,
hastened on everything without judgment. I
grasped at the guessings and conjectures of
others!”</p>

<p>The ice on the surface of the Neva was still
under water, the remains of the previous day’s
inundation. The prince’s carriage drove on very
slowly, and with difficulty through the pools of
water. He did not find the commandant at home.
Ever since evening the latter had been in the
Ravelin. At the door stood Oushakoff with
papers in his hand. He walked up to the prince,
and was beginning&mdash;</p>

<p>“As your Grace knows, the expenses for this
person.…”</p>

<p>“Lead me to the captive,” said the prince,
addressing the officer on guard, and turning his
back on Oushakoff. “Umph! found occupation!&mdash;And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
our sick captive? Is she still conscious?”</p>

<p>“She is dying,” answered the officer.</p>

<p>Galitzin devoutly crossed himself.</p>

<p>On entering the Ravelin, he met Tchernishoff.
The prince did not recognise him. The brave,
fine, spruce officer, Tchernishoff, who was never
once in his life embarrassed by his service, was
now quite bewildered and pale as death.</p>

<p>“Poor thing!” murmured the field-marshal,
following Tchernishoff. “Can it be that she will
die? Has the doctor been?”</p>

<p>“He has not left her since evening; the agony
has already begun, she is quite unconscious. She
is raving!”</p>

<p>“What does she rave about? Speak, speak!”
and the agitated prince leant forward to Tchernishoff.
“Were you there? Did you hear her
ravings?”</p>

<p>“I went in several times,” answered the commandant.
“I only heard some unintelligible
words, amongst them Orloff … Princess …
Gran Dio … Mio caro.…”</p>

<p>“And the child?” asked the prince, dashing
away a tear.</p>

<p>“Is well, your Grace, in the hands of a wet
nurse. My wife found a very good one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“See that everything necessary is found&mdash;everything.
Do you hear me, sir? everything,”
said the prince very seriously and impressively,
trying to give his voice a most imperious and
commanding tone. “In a Christian manner, do
you understand?… In case, here …
in secret … you understand me? without any
fuss … suffering humanity … a martyr.”</p>

<p>The prince wanted to say something more, but
could only sob. Tears were choking him. He
merely nodded, and, pulling himself together as
well as he could, he briskly walked out on the
<i lang="fr">perron</i>. Here he glanced at the dismal grey sky,
covered with big heavy clouds. A whole flight
of ravens was whirling round over the Ravelin.
The iron leaves<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> of the roof, half torn away by
the storm, were creaking dismally. The field-marshal
drew his sable collar close round him,
jumped into his carriage, and shouted, “Home!”</p>

<p>“God has had pity on her, poor thing; in past
years, how often these small casemates have been
flooded during the inundations. Yes, of course,
it’s quite clear,” he went on musing. “The unfortunate
girl has only been a toy in the hands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
others. A usurper or not, who can tell? That’s
just what I shall write to Her Imperial Highness&mdash;her
death will not be on our heads.”</p>

<p>The carriage rolled along quickly over the
newly-fallen snow, now passing carts loaded with
wood or hay, now an elegant carriage, or a
pedestrian feeling his way carefully through the
pools and the snow,&mdash;those very same houses,
churches, the same bridges, ensigns, that the
prince had looked at for so many years, rushed
past unnoticed by the now anxious and gloomy
commander-in-chief of the northern capital.
Then came the Police Department, at the Green
Bridge over the Nevski, and at last the apartment
of the field-marshal. His heart was very heavy.</p>

<p>“Well! and if, after all, she’s no pretender,”
flashed through the mind of the prince, as he
saw the Elizabeth Palace rising in the gloom,
near the bridge on the Moïka, and a little farther
on, on the Nevski, the Anitchkoff Hall, the residence
of Razoumovski.</p>

<p>Galitzin remembered now all the late reign,
the great of that time, his connections, his own
youthful years, and the years and persons that
time had carried away.</p>

<p class="tb">On the evening of 4th of December, 1775, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Princess Tarakanova, Dame d’Azow, Ali Emeté,
and Princess Wladimirskaya, expired. No one
was present at her last moments; she was found
lying still, as though she had fallen asleep. Her
dim open eyes were fixed on the image of the
Saviour. On the next day the invalid watch of
the garrison of the Petropavlovski fortress dug
a grave, with the help of crow-bars<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and spades,
in the middle of the little yard in the Ravelin
of Alexéef, under the shade of the lindens. And
there, secretly from all, they buried the body of
the unfortunate girl, filling the grave up with
clods of frozen earth. The invalid watchman,
Antipitch, on his own initiative, planted a birch
tree over that grave. The servitors of the Princess,
her maid Meshade, and secretary Charnomski,
as the inquest now was terminated, were sent
away to foreign parts, after having been sworn
to secrecy.</p>

<p>Father Peter guessed at the death of the captive,
from the tears and insinuations of the <i lang="ru">commandantsha</i>,
and said to himself, “Oh, God! Thou
hast at last delivered the poor unfortunate captive
from her burden, and given rest to her soul.”
And, without any fuss or noise, went immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
to the church and celebrated a funeral
mass, for the fallen asleep bond-slave of God,
Elizabeth; and at the oblation, remembering her
soul, cut a small piece from the consecrated loaf.</p>

<p>“For whom did you have that funeral mass?”
asked Vâra of her uncle, noticing the loaf on the
breakfast table.</p>

<p>“For that person you know of, that poor
sufferer.”</p>

<p>“But who was she?”</p>

<p>“A slave, and child of a bond-slave,” mysteriously
answered Father Peter. “We are all in the
hands of God, the rich and the poor, the slaves
and the kings.”</p>

<p class="tb">The Field-Marshal Galitzin was unable for a
long time to decide on the means of letting the
empress know of the death of Tarakanova. He
would take a pen, write a few lines, dash them
out, and again begin thinking.</p>

<p>“Ah! come what may,” said he to himself,
“the dead will not be called to account, and for
the living, it’s a vindication.”</p>

<p>The prince took out a clean sheet of paper,
dipped his pen in the ink, and began very carefully
to trace, in an old-fashioned hand, the
following words:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>“The person so well known to your Imperial
Highness as having usurped a name and rank
not belonging to her, died on the 4th of December,
an unrepentant sinner, having confessed to
nothing and betrayed no one.”</p>

<p>“And if any of the great should learn anything
about her, and let it out,” thought Galitzin to
himself, “we can set rumours afloat that she was
drowned in the inundation. Just at that very
time, they fired enough cannon from the fortress,
and the lovely Neva played her pranks.”</p>

<p>And this is the origin of the legend of the
drowning of Tarakanova.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p class="tb">Irena Lvovna Rakitina, after having gone about
from department to department, was at last convinced
of the hopelessness of her case, and returned
to her native village accompanied by Vâra.
This was in December, 1775. In Moscow, she
tried to give a personal petition to the empress,
but this was just the day before the departure of
Ekaterina for Petersburg. The petition of Irena
was graciously accepted; but somehow very
likely, in the confusion dependent on the departure
of the Court,&mdash;it got lost and was forgotten,
as she never received any answer or resolution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Irena, while at Moscow, determined to find out
Orloff, but afterward was dissuaded from her
purpose.</p>

<p>On her arrival in Petersburg, the empress
most assiduously questioned Galitzin about the
last days of the captive; and notwithstanding all
the endeavours of the old man to soften his
tale, she understood what an awful tragedy
had overtaken the blind victim of foreign intrigue.</p>

<p>“Yes; you and I, prince, have also ‘oversalted’
it!” said Ekaterina. “Why not more frankness
with me?”</p>

<p class="tb">“I am the cause of everything,” decided Irena,
after long hours of doubt and anguish. “I was
the cause of Konsov’s leaving his native land.
It was on my account he gave way to despair,
and tried to help that unfortunate person, and
then perished. I must make amends now for his
broken life, and implore God to forgive me my
share of sins in all this unhappy affair. I am
now alone, and have nothing to expect from the
world.”</p>

<p>In 1776, Rakitina left her estate in the hands
of her father’s serfs, and accompanied by Vâra
(who had that year become engaged to one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
teachers of the Muscovite Seminary), started for
a small nunnery not far from Kieff, and entered
it as a novice, hoping soon to be able to take the
veil. However much Vâra implored her, or tried
to convince her, to dissuade her from taking such
a step, Irena was firm, and having put on the
hood and nun’s dress, repeated only one thing&mdash;“I
am the cause of all, and therefore must pray
for him, and suffer all my life.” But Irena could
not give up all her thoughts to prayer, however
much she wished to.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>“A ROSE AND A MYRTLE.”</i></span></h3>

<p>Five years passed by, and in May, 1780, Rakitina
was again in Petersburg. Her friend Vâra
was already married and in Moscow. Father
Peter was, as before, priest of the Cathedral of
Kazan. Irena went to see him. He was delighted
and eagerly began to ask her about past
and present events.</p>

<p>“Is it possible that you are even till now
waiting and hoping that your <i lang="fr">fiancé</i> is yet alive?”
he asked. “For how many years you are uselessly
tormenting yourself! Were he alive, be
sure he would have sent some message&mdash;I do not
say to you&mdash;to his friends, to his relations.”</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t, don’t, Father,” answered Irena,
drying her eyes; “I will give up all, sacrifice
everything.…”</p>

<p>“Young lady, that is a sin; you are tempting
Providence, you are imitating the heathens.”</p>

<p>“But what can I do?” answered Irena; “I
am always seeing such awful prophetic dreams,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
one especially. Oh! that dream; it came to me
not long ago, several nights together.”…
Irena was silent.</p>

<p>“What dream was it? Tell me all; confide
in me.”</p>

<p>“It seemed to me that he approached my bedside&mdash;he
was not a bit altered&mdash;just as he was
the last time I saw him in our village, stately,
handsome, amiable; and he said to me, ‘I am
still alive, Irenushka. Where the sea murmurs,
night and day, I look for you, morning and
evening, thinking perhaps you’ll come, find me,
and set me free.’… Ah! tell me, where must
I look, what must I do, whom must I ask? I
dare not trouble the empress another time.…”</p>

<p>“I often thought of you,” said Father Peter.
“Here I only see one person, and that is&mdash;the
Tzarevitch, Pavel Petrovitch;<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> he is Grand-Master
and Protector of the Order of Maltese
Knights&mdash;he alone can help you. If he will only
stoop to you, to your petition, he alone can do
something for you. In him you’ll find everything&mdash;talent,
honour, always used in the interest of
anything high and noble, secret relations with all
the most powerful and celebrated philanthropists.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
And what goodness, what knightly nobility! No;
it is not Tiberius, as his enemies say; it’s the
future beneficent Titus.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have heard that,” answered Irena.</p>

<p>“You have heard? then go to him, find him
at his manor house, seek for an audience.”</p>

<p>The priest gave Irena all possible information
and advice, as well as a letter to his god-daughter,
housekeeper in the household of the Tzarevitch.
Rakitina hired a <i lang="ru">kibitka</i><a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and started for Pavlovski,
the personal property of the grand-duke.</p>

<p>The housekeeper received Rakitina very hospitably.
She took her into her own apartment,
and then, to amuse her a little, pointed out to her
all the curiosities in the garden and park of the
grand-duke; the little cottage Cric-Crac, the hut
of the hermit, the caverns, lakes, and rustic
bridges. It was decided that Irena should first
relate everything to the favourite maid of honour
of the grand-duchess, Ekaterina Ivanovna Nelidova,
who had only just terminated her education
at Smolney Institute.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“When shall we go to see Ekaterina Ivanovna?”
said Irena, longing for the promised
audience.</p>

<p>“We shall have to wait; she is very much
occupied now, learning a hymn on the clavichord.
It’s the favourite piece of the grand-duke; she
is getting it ready for the concert.”</p>

<p>One day Irena was walking in the park with
her hostess. All at once from behind the trees,
a fair lady in a light blue silk dress, without any
hoops, came towards them.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” asked Irena.</p>

<p>“The Tzarevna,” whispered the housekeeper,
bowing very respectfully.</p>

<p>Irena turned faint.</p>

<p>The elegant, though a little inclined to embonpoint,
Grand Duchess Marie Feodorovna was then
twenty-two, and very lovely.</p>

<p>In passing by Irena, she turned her rather
bewildered and short-sighted eyes upon her, as
though astonished at her nun’s dress. The Tzarevna
was followed by a very tall, thin, pock-marked
man in a dark <i>kaftan</i> and cocked hat,
carrying a roll of music and a fiddle under his
arm.</p>

<p>“And who is that?” asked Rakitina, when
they had gone by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“Paëzsïllo,” answered the housekeeper;
“music master to her Imperial Highness.”</p>

<p>Irena admired the rare beauty of the Tzarevna,
the delicate pink and white complexion, the
splendid golden hair, in which nestled some blue
and red flowers, contained in a tiny bottle of
water to keep them fresh.</p>

<p>The Tzarevna was followed at some distance
by two maids of honour. One of them, a short,
thin, sprightly brunette, struck Irena by the
brightness of her black, sparkling eyes, which
literally seemed to shoot forth sparks. She was
gaily talking with her companion. It was Nelidova.
Mischievously winking at the stout housekeeper,
who was respectfully bowing to her, she
said to her with a charming smile, “I’ve had no
time yet, Anna Romanovna,&mdash;always that hymn;
to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“Ah! at last, to-morrow,” thought Irena, in
ecstasy, and following with enraptured eyes the
enchanting, elegant fairies, who so unexpectedly
had passed before her eyes. At the appointed
hour, Anna Romanovna took Irena to the
pavilion of the maids of honour, not far from
the guard-house, and led her into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>“It would seem that Ekaterina Ivanovna has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
not yet returned from the palace of the grand-duchess,”
she said; “we will wait for her here,
my dear; take off your hood, it’s too warm.”</p>

<p>“It does not matter; I’ll leave it.”</p>

<p>The room was filled with vases, statuettes, and
medallions hung on the walls.</p>

<p>“This is all the work of the grand-duchess,”
said the housekeeper. “Look here, dear,
what talent! how she paints on porcelain!
And look here, in this black cupboard, these
ivory things, that’s her work. She can engrave
also on stones, on gold, lovely <i lang="fr">paysages</i>; she can
also turn on the lathe, and how fond she is
of Ekaterina Ivanovna! those are all presents
to her. Look, she embroidered this beautiful
cushion for her. Look, what a rose! and this
myrtle! What a delicate design, and the colours,
you might mistake it for a painting.”</p>

<p>Irena gave no answer.</p>

<p>“Why are you so silent, my dear? What are
you thinking about?”</p>

<p>“A rose and a myrtle,” whispered Irena, sighing;
“life and death. What will be the end of
all my efforts, my researches, my hopes?”</p>

<p>At that very minute, the notes of the clavichord
were heard from the room of Nelidova. A
melodious splendid contralto was singing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
very solemn and sad hymn from Glück’s opera,
“Iphigenia in Tauridus.”</p>

<p>“Well, Irena Lvovna, let us go; I suppose
we are too late. Ekaterina Ivanovna is at her
music, and no one will dare disturb her. Very
likely the grand-duchess is with her now.”</p>

<p>Irena made a sign to her companion to wait a
little, and with a beating heart she listened to
the so well known notes of the imploring hymn
of “Iphigenia.” In past days she had herself
sung that to Konsov. “Oh! if I could only
implore them like that; but when will that be?
They have their own cares, they have no time,”
thought she, feeling that her tears were choking
her.</p>

<p>“Let us go, let us go,” said Anna Romanovna,
hastily. They both went out together, went
down the steps, round the pavilion of the maids
of honour, and into the garden. The wicket-gate
banged to.</p>

<p>“Where are you off to?” they heard a voice
gaily calling out.</p>

<p>They both raised their eyes. Looking at them
from the open window was the smiling face of the
black-eyed Nelidova.</p>

<p>“Come in; I’m quite free now. I was waiting
for you, and so began to sing. Come in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>The visitors retraced their steps.</p>

<p>Anna Romanovna presented her companion to
Nelidova, who made her sit down beside her.</p>

<p>“So young, and yet in such a gloomy dress,”
she said; “speak now, without any ceremony,
tell me all, I am listening.”</p>

<p>Irena began about Konsov, then went on to
the arrest and captivity of Tarakanova. At each
of her words, at each detail of the sad event, the
bright playful face of Nelidova became more and
more troubled and sad.</p>

<p>“Great God! what mysteries, what tragedies!”
thought she, shivering; “and all that in our
days. But it’s the dark middle ages over again,
and no one knowing anything of it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mademoiselle Irena,” said
Ekaterina Ivanovna, after having listened attentively
to Rakitina. “I am very much obliged to
you for all you have related to me; if you will
allow me, I will tell it all again to their Imperial
Highnesses.… I am convinced that the
Tzarevitch, that wise just knight, that angel of
goodness and honour … will do everything
for you. But to whom must he apply?”</p>

<p>“How! to whom?” asked the astonished
Irena.</p>

<p>“You see, I do not know very well how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
explain it,” continued Nelidova; “the Tzarevitch
takes no part in State affairs, he can only ask
others. On whom does all this depend?”</p>

<p>“The Prince Potemkin might …” answered
Irena, remembering the counsels of Father Peter,
that the Prince could send orders to the different
ambassadors and consuls. “Lieutenant
Konsov is perhaps now a prisoner of the Moors
or negroes, on some wild island in the Atlantic
Ocean.”</p>

<p>“Will you remain long here?” asked Nelidova.</p>

<p>“The Mother Superior of the Nunnery where
I live has been summoning me to return this
long while. Every one blames me; calls my
researches sinful.”</p>

<p>“How and where can I send you a message?”</p>

<p>Irena named the convent, and then became
thoughtful, looking at the cushion worked by the
grand-duchess.</p>

<p>“I’ve suffered so much, I’ve waited so long,”
she murmured, stifling her tears. “Do not write
anything&mdash;not one word&mdash;but, see, send me,
should there be success, a rose; if failure, a
myrtle leaf.”</p>

<p>Nelidova kissed Irena.</p>

<p>“I will do everything I can,” she said gently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
“I will appeal to the grand-duchess, to the
Tzarevitch. There remains nothing more for
you to do here. Better leave, my dear one;
as soon as I learn anything, I will let you
know.”</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>PAVEL PETROVITCH AND THE ENCHANTER.</i></span></h3>

<p>There was still no news. It was the beginning
of the year 1781. With the retirement of Prince
Gregory Orloff, and the fallen fortunes of the
tutor of the Tzarevitch, Pânin, the new counsellors
of the Empress Ekaterina, having in view
the lessening of the influence of her son, Pavel
Petrovitch, advised her to send the Tzarevitch and
his wife on a long foreign journey, ostensibly
to make the acquaintance of foreign courts.</p>

<p>Irena learnt this with a beating heart from
Vâra’s letter. Their Imperial Highnesses left
the environs of Petersburg on the 19th of September,
1781. Under the name of Count and
Countess “du Nord,” they passed the Russian
frontier of Poland, at the little town of Oukraine,
Vasilkoff, in the middle of October.</p>

<p>A young person, dressed in the dark vestments
of a nun, who arrived the day before by the
Kieff track,<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> was waiting here to meet Nelidova.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
She was taken into the apartment of Ekaterina
Ivanovna. Into this room there entered also,
from the garden, the Count and Countess du
Nord, as if by accident, whilst the horses were
being changed. They remained several minutes,
and when they came out, the count was fearfully
pale, and the countess in tears.</p>

<p>“Poor Penelope,” said Pavel to Nelidova,
getting into the carriage, on observing through
the trees the dark figure of Irena.</p>

<p>The conversation of Ekaterina Ivanovna with
the stranger after the departure of the august
travellers was so prolonged that the carriage of
the maid of honour was much behindhand, according
to the <i lang="fr">marche-route</i>, and the horses had to be
cruelly driven to catch up the Imperial carriages.</p>

<p>“A rose, a rose! Not myrtle!” cried out
Nelidova in French,&mdash;very mysteriously to all
around,&mdash;to the stranger, to whom she waved her
handkerchief from the carriage window, by way
of encouragement.</p>

<p>“She is truly a sorrowing Penelope,” said
Ekaterina Ivanovna, as, driving away, she lost
sight in the distance of the dark motionless
figure of Irena.</p>

<p>The journey of the Count and Countess du
Nord was very interesting. They travelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
through all Germany, and spent the New Year
in Venice. The 8th of January, 1780, the grand-duke,
Pavel Petrovitch, wrapped in the picturesque
Italian cloak <i lang="it">Tabaro</i>, and the grand-duchess,
in the graceful Venetian mantilla and
the <i lang="it">Cendadi</i>, visited the picture gallery and the
palace of the Doge in the morning, and in the evening
went to the theatre of the “Prophet Samuel,”
where “Iphigenia in Tauridus,” was to be played
in honour of the august visitors, as it was known
to be their favourite opera. The celebrated
composer Glück himself conducted the orchestra.</p>

<p>After the opera, the public poured out, and
crowded the square of St. Mark, where a national
masquerade had been organised in honour of the
Imperial travellers.</p>

<p>The square was covered with a noisy, vivacious
crowd. Every one noticed that the Count du Nord,
after having led the Countess straight from the
theatre to the palace which had been prepared
for them, was walking, wearing a mask, up and
down, a little out of the way of the crowd, with
a very tall foreigner, also masked, whom Glück
himself had presented to him at the opera.</p>

<p>The full moon shed her silvery light, and all
around there were many coloured fires and lamps.
The noise and chattering of the mixed crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
failed to attract the attention of the two interlocutors.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” asked a lady of her husband,
turning his attention to the fact that the Count
du Nord was attentively listening to the conversation
of the foreigner by his side. “Don’t you
know him again&mdash;the friend of Glück&mdash;our celebrated
necromancer, our raiser of ghosts?”</p>

<p>Pavel was very much agitated, and in a bad
humour. He had wanted to make fun of the
stranger, but the recollection of a certain fact had
involuntarily embarrassed him.</p>

<p>“You, Enchanter, living, according to your
own words, an innumerable number of years,”
said he, very politely, although in a slightly
mocking tone; “you are in connection not only
with the living, but with those beyond the tomb.
That is, doubtless, one of your jokes, and I, of
course, do not believe one word of it,” he added,
trying to be very amiable; “it would be silly to
believe such tales. But there are tales and tales,
you understand me?… I should very much
like to question you concerning a certain incident.…”</p>

<p>“I am at your orders,” said the stranger.</p>

<p>“For instance,&mdash;and this is quite a conversation
<i lang="fr">àpropos</i>,” continued the Count du Nord; “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
have always been very much interested in the
supernatural, especially in the inexplicable interference
of supernatural agents in our intellectual
life. I should very much like … I would
ask you, as we have met so unexpectedly, to
explain to me one very mysterious event, a very
strange meeting.…”</p>

<p>“I am quite at your service,” answered the
stranger, politely bowing.</p>

<p>His companion walked on a few steps silently.</p>

<p>Pavel struggled within himself, trying to trip
up the conjurer, and at the same time to stifle
in his own heart something very sad, torturing,
which was perhaps one of his mental tribulations.
Raising his mask, he wiped his brow.</p>

<p>“I once saw a spirit,” he said, hesitatingly,
unable to restrain his emotion; “I saw a shadow,
sacred to me.…”</p>

<p>The stranger bowed slightly, following Pavel,
who turned the corner of the square to the
dimly-lighted river side.</p>

<p>“It was in Petersburg,” again began the
count. He then related to his companion the
celebrated fact, already made known somehow
abroad, of his having seen the spirit of his
ancestor; how, on a certain moonlight night,
walking along the streets with his aide-de-camp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
he had felt that between him and the wall of the
house on the left side there rose all at once
something in a long cloak and old-fashioned
cocked hat&mdash;how he had “<em>felt</em>” that apparition,
by the icy cold which had frozen his left side, and
with what horror he had followed step by step
the apparition, which noisily struck the pavement&mdash;it
was the noise of stone against stone.</p>

<p>The apparition, invisible to the aide-de-camp,
had addressed Pavel in a sad, reproachful voice:
“Pavel, poor Pavel, poor prince, do not love the
world too much; you will not remain long in it;
fear the reproaches of thy conscience; live by the
laws of justice … in life.…”</p>

<p>“The apparition did not finish,” said the
count. “I still did not understand what it was.
At last I looked up and turned giddy; before me,
in the full moonlight, stood my grandfather,
Peter the Great, just as I remembered him. I
recognised directly his caressing look of love,
fixed on me. I wanted to ask him … but
he disappeared, and I remained leaning against
the bare, cold wall.” Saying these last words,
Pavel again raised his mask, and wiped his face
with his handkerchief; he was pale and very
much embarrassed. It seemed as though before
his eyes there again rose, the dear, sad apparition.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>A MYRTLE LEAF.</i></span></h3>

<p>“What do you think, Signor?” asked the count,
after a short pause. “Was it a dream, or did I
really see the spirit of my grandfather?”</p>

<p>“It was his spirit,” answered his companion.</p>

<p>“What did his words mean, and why did he
not finish them?”</p>

<p>“Would you like to know?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Some one disturbed him.”</p>

<p>“But who?” asked Pavel, continuing to walk
along the deserted river side.</p>

<p>“The apparition disappeared at my approach.
I was just leaving at that time your banker,
Sutherland. You did not notice me, but I saw
you both, and I involuntarily startled the apparition
of the great man.”</p>

<p>The count stopped; he was amused, and at the
same time indignant at the impudence of the
magician, and yet there remained something more
to be learnt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are joking,” said he. “How is it you
were in Petersburg, and no one heard anything
of it?”</p>

<p>“I had that pleasure&mdash;but for a very short
time. I was received in a very unfriendly
manner. As a foreigner, and one fond of knowledge,
I had expected to obtain more attention.
But the first minister offended me deeply; he
invited me to leave the country. I withdrew my
money from the bankers, and that very same
night left Petersburg.”</p>

<p>“Fool, jackanapes!” thought the count, contemptuously
smiling; “what inventions, what
yarns he can spin.”</p>

<p>“Allow me to offer my apologies for the rudeness
of our ministers,” said the count, with the
most elaborate politeness, slightly touching his
hat with his hand. “But can you explain to me
the meaning of the words of the apparition?”</p>

<p>“It would be better not to seek to know
the meaning of the apparition,” answered the
stranger. “There are things … on which
it is better to let the Fates be silent.…”</p>

<p>At that moment the sounds of a lute came
floating from the great lagoon. Some one seated
in a gondola was singing. Pavel eagerly listened;
it was his favourite hymn. It brought back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
to his recollection the Manor of Pavlovski, the
musical mornings at Nelidova’s, and her intercession
for Rakitina.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said he; “let it be so; the future
will reveal the truth. But I have another favour
to ask of you.… A certain person, whom
I wish from my whole heart to help at any cost,
would very much like to know one thing.”</p>

<p>“I shall be most happy,” answered the stranger;
“if I can be of any use to your Highness.”</p>

<p>“A certain person,” continued the count,
“begged me to make inquiries here in Italy, in
Spain, and in general, of seamen, if a certain
naval officer is still living. He was on that ship
which was totally shipwrecked, five years ago,
and of which literally nothing has been heard.”</p>

<p>“A Russian ship?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It was carried away, and dashed to pieces by
the storm in the ocean, not far from Africa?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Northern Eagle</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but how came you to know?”</p>

<p>“It’s not in vain I’m called an Enchanter.”</p>

<p>“Speak! make haste, was he saved? is he still
alive, this officer?” said the count, impatiently.</p>

<p>At that moment they were both standing on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
water side. The silvery waves gently rippled up
to the stone steps. In the distance, in the dim
twilight, the outline of a ship with her sails
furled was just discernible.</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” said the stranger, “I leave
Venice on that schooner; but before sailing, or
answering your question, I should like&mdash;excuse
me&mdash;to know … whether the Count du
Nord, on ascending the throne, will be more
indulgent to me than the ministers of his august
parent? Will he allow me then to visit that
country again, whatever the tenor of my answer
concerning that naval officer?”</p>

<p>The deep agitation which Pavel had experienced,
on relating his adventure with the apparition,
had already subsided, and he was regaining
his self-composure. The question of the man
aroused his indignation.</p>

<p>“Impudent, audacious impostor,” thought he,
in a fit of suspicious anger. “What insolence!
and what a turn he has given to the conversation.
Street acrobat! charlatan!…”</p>

<p>Pavel could scarcely contain himself, and
crushed his glove in his hand.</p>

<p>“According to your own words it is rather difficult
to answer for the future,” said he thoughtfully,
after a short pause. “Nevertheless, I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
convinced, that on a second journey to Russia,
you will meet with a reception more polite and
more befitting a foreigner.”</p>

<p>His interlocutor bowed profoundly.</p>

<p>“So you wish to know the fate of that naval
officer?” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Pavel, prepared, however, to
hear some tomfoolery, some imposture.</p>

<p>“Send that certain person awaiting your news
a myrtle leaf.”</p>

<p>“How? what did you say? Say it again,”
cried out Pavel. “Myrtle! myrtle? then he is
lost.…”</p>

<p>“He was saved on a fragment of the ship
near the island of Teneriffe, and for some time
remained with the poor monks of the coast.”</p>

<p>“And now? oh! speak, I implore you.”</p>

<p>“A year after he was killed by pirates, who
pillaged the monastery where he was living.”</p>

<p>“How did you learn all this?”</p>

<p>“At that time I was myself living on the isle
of Teneriffe,” he answered. “I was copying an
old Latin manuscript, which was very precious to
me, from the archives of the monastery.”</p>

<p>“But what does all this mean? Is he only a
juggler, or an all-powerful seer?” thought Pavel,
torn with doubts. “A clever diviner, or a bold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
charlatan, but from where?… All my most
secret … coast of Africa … the
name of the lost ship … and then that
token, the fatal myrtle. Is it possible Ekaterina
Ivanovna should have betrayed me? But he
never saw her; she is ill, has never been once
out of her room, received no visits, and has been
nowhere.…”</p>

<p>Pavel wanted to say something else, but could
find no words.</p>

<p>Beyond the schooner the dawn was breaking.</p>

<p>“I will accompany your Highness to the
palace,” said the stranger with elaborate politeness
and a cringing bow; “have I your permission?”</p>

<p>Pavel slightly glanced at the tawdry cotton-velvet
bespangled costume of the wizard, looking
so shabby in the morning light, and taking off
his mask, without saying one word more, strode
gloomily and proudly along the deserted shore.</p>

<p>“Poor sorrowing Penelope! unfortunate lovely
Irena!” thought he. “No one has been able to
solve that anguishful enigma&mdash;neither ministers,
nor knights, nor ambassadors; let us send her
the myrtle leaf of the Italian wizard and juggler.”</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER.</i></span></h3>

<p>Fifteen years had passed away; the year 1796
was drawing to its end. It was in the beginning
of the reign of Pavel I. All Petersburg was hailing
joyfully the liberation of the celebrated Novikoff
from the fortress, and the return from Siberia
of Radischeff. The emperor, with his august
consort and several courtiers, went to visit the
fortress of Petropavlovski. The chief of the
police, Arharoff, asked the emperor if he would
not like to visit the Ravelin of Alexéef, where
great alterations and repairs were taking place.
One of the dungeons attracted the attention of
the Imperial visitors.</p>

<p>“Were any Italians ever confined here?”
asked the emperor of the commandant.</p>

<p>“Never, your Highness; only schismatics.”</p>

<p>“Well, look here,” and the Emperor pointed to
the window, “here’s an inscription on the glass,
cut with a diamond. ‘O, Dio mio.’”</p>

<p>Arharoff and the commandant both bent towards
the window eagerly. The commandant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
was new, and therefore had not yet had time to
become acquainted with all the legends and past
days of the fortress.</p>

<p>“It would be very interesting to know,” said
the Empress Marie Feodorovna. “It’s a woman’s
hand. Poor thing, who could it have been?”</p>

<p>“Was it not Tarakanova?” said Nelidova,
standing by. “Have you forgotten, your Highness,
the unfortunate Konsov, and the young
lady from Little Russia?”</p>

<p>“Tarakanova was drowned here at the time of
the inundation,” said somebody.</p>

<p>Every one was silent; the Empress Marie
Feodorovna alone looked at Nelidova, and pointed
with her eyes out of the window at a solitary
silver birch tree, growing in the middle of the
little neglected garden of the Ravelin.</p>

<p>“That’s her grave,” she whispered. “Do you
remember? But what can have become of the
diary?”</p>

<p>It was plain that the emperor had heard the
words. As he took his seat in the carriage, he
remarked to Arharoff, “At whatever cost this
affair must be looked into; a most painful event
here took place. They were troublous times;
the attempt of Merovitch, the insurrection of
Pougachoff, and then … this unfortunate.…
I saw my mother’s tears; to her very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
last days she could not forgive herself for allowing
the poor girl to be interrogated during her
absence from Petersburg.”</p>

<p>The police were all set on foot.</p>

<p>Somewhere in an almshouse they discovered
the poor blind invalid, Antipitch. He had been
watchman in the fortress twenty years before.
The invalid directed them to a gardener, and this
one again to the warden of the cathedral of
Kazan, who said that he had found a trunk filled
with papers after the death of Father Peter, and
that he knew that in it there had been a roll of
very important papers. Search was made for the
family of Father Peter. He had left no direct
heirs, but his grand-niece, the daughter of his
niece Vâra, was found. Arharoff went himself
to see her, but she knew nothing. No one knew
what had become of the trunk of papers of Father
Peter, or whether it had been sent to Moscow with
his other things. Everything was found out in
time. In the poor retired nunnery of the Oukraine,
where Irena had sought refuge, after having taken
the veil, she peacefully died, at an advanced age,
fervently praying for her <i lang="fr">fiancé</i>, the lost Konsov.
Amongst the effects of the deceased lay a packet
of papers, with the inscription “From Father
Peter,” and there, together with a letter from a
very influential personage, a faded myrtle leaf. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
neighbour, who was very fond of antiquities, had
borrowed these papers from the Lady Superior.
He had subsequently died abroad.</p>

<p class="tb">Count Alexis Gregorevitch Orloff-Chesmenski
married, the very year that the Count and
Countess du Nord were travelling abroad. His
illegitimate son by the Princess Tarakanova, Alexander
Chesmenski, died, in the rank of Brigadier,
at the close of the last century. Having survived
the Empress Ekaterina and the Emperor Pavel,
the Count Orloff died in Moscow, in the reign
of the Emperor Alexander I., on Christmas Eve,
1807, leaving an only unmarried daughter, the
well-known Countess Anna Alexéevna. It remains
a secret till now whether his conscience tormented
him for his treachery to Tarakanova, or whether
the stings of remorse had no hold on his hardened
soul. However, it is a well-known fact,
that the agonies of death must have been for
Count Orloff especially terrible, because, in order
to drown the horrible screams and groans of the
dying “Giant of his time,” it was found necessary
to make his private orchestra, at that time learning
a sonata in the neighbouring pavilion, play
as loudly as possible.</p>

But historians differ as to this. Some say that when Boris
Godounoff (the Russian Oliver Cromwell) planned to kill
Dimitri, some faithful friends hid the Tzarevitch, and sent
him to the Polish Court, where he was brought up, and that
afterwards he came into Russia with many adherents and an
army of several thousands, the majority of whom were Poles.
He reigned less than a year, being killed during an insurrection,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
